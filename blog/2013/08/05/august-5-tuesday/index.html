	<div class="entry-content"><h1>What is Enlightenment?</h1>

<p>Rousseau wrote about being stirred (перемешивать) by his passions and he stirred passions of others. He is the conscience of the enlightenment, bad <strong>conscience of the enlightenment. He rejects it.</strong> <em>He participates in the enlightenment and he turns against it.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>One day I took the Mercure de France (newspaper), and galncing throught it as I walked, I came upon this question propounded by the Dijon Academy for the next year&#8217;s prize, &#8221;<strong>Has the progress of sciences and arts done more to corrupt morals, or to improve them?</strong>&#8221; The moment I read this, I beheld another universe and became an other man. <strong>Confessions</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1>Discourse - The Arts and Sciences</h1>

<p>Have the arts and science contributed to morals? Rousseau expected people will talk about it in the way about improving and making the world better, as we&#8217;ve said that&#8217;s what enlightenment is. What could be bad? And Rousseau says quite the opposite:</p>

<blockquote><p>While the Government and the Laws see to the safety and the well being of men assembled, the Sciences, Letters and Arts, less despotic and perhaps more powerful, spread garlands of flowers over the iron chains with which they are laden, throttle in them the sentiment of that original freedom for which they seemed born, make them love their slavery, and fashion them into what is called civilized peoples.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The arts and science cover up our oppressions. They make us forget that we&#8217;re not free, even worse, they make us love our slavery. They don&#8217;t promote knowledge and understanding, they promote tyranny and inequality.</strong></p>

<p>The arts and sciences create new form of needs, <strong>new forms of dependence</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Princes] know that all needs which a People imposes on itself are so many chains which it assumes&#8230; Indeed what yoke could be imposed on men who need nothing?</p></blockquote>

<p>The arts and sciences become luxuries, they promote in us new forms of dependence. We don&#8217;t need them to begin with, but once we have the Arts and Science, then they are deprived of them at some point, we feel pain, we feel we&#8217;re missing something.</p>

<p>For Rousseua this was as creating new forms of dependences, vulnerability is a form of degradation and corruption, not progress.</p>

<blockquote><p>What conclusion is to be drawn from this paradox so worthy of being born in our time; and what will become of virtue when one hat to get richt at all cost? The ancient political thinkers forever spoke of morals and of virtuel ours pseak only of commerce and money.</p></blockquote>

<p>In those good od days we were simpler, we were content to be more honest with one another.</p>

<h2>relationship of learning and luxury:</h2>

<blockquote><p>What gives rise to all of these abuses, if not the fatal inequality introduced among men by the distinction of talents and the disparagement of the virtues? This is the most obvios effect of all our studies, and the most dangerous in its consequences.</p></blockquote>

<p>You get some people who seem to be really smart and other people who aren&#8217;t so smart. You begin to get <strong>some people who look up to the writer, the pholosopher, the scientist</strong> and <strong>say, oh, I wish I could be like that</strong>. <strong>At this moment you have introduced a whole form of corruption.</strong></p>

<p>That it&#8217;s going to be a slippery slope for human beings because they will try to be someone they are not and <strong>for Rousseau that is a form of dishonesty.</strong></p>

<p>Writes get into this more all the time, scientists, thinkers get into this mode, they are perfoming for someone else, they are creating luxuries, introducing inequality and <strong>under the guise</strong> (облик) of <strong>promoting knowledge</strong> they are promoting a kind of <strong>dishonesty</strong>, we might call today <strong>inauthenticity</strong> (недостоверность).</p>

<p>Slippery slope of modernity. We&#8217;re getting further and further away from who we naturally should be, who are by nature.</p>

<p>But, in the end of discorse we see a little surprise after those previous radical talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let learned men of the first rank find honorable asylum in their courts. Let them there receive the only reward worthy of them; by the credit they enjoy, to contribute to the happiness of the People to whom they have taught wisdom.
* he&#8217;s just told us why inequality is so bad, slippery slope of enlightment. what he says is the cure? To give th esmart people power. Why is that? Because we can&#8217;t go backward, can&#8217;t strip off our enlightenment and go backwards. This is the diasese, the cure is to use learned men, to try to institute political change.</p></blockquote>
