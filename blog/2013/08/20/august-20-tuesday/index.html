	<div class="entry-content"><p>When people think they are going beyond the common place, that&#8217;s the time to really be suspicious. Romantism rejected mechanistic approach to happines or to pleasure. <strong>The Romantics</strong> value emotions, they value conflict, interested in nature as a scene of turbulence, they value authenticity, a kind of deep honesty and an expression of the soul and the arts, very importantly. Flaubert understands romanticism inside out, but he rejects it. He thinks it leads to <strong>stupidity and cliche</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Those who were beginning to age had a youthful look, while a touch of maturity overlay the faces of the younger. In their indiferent gazes floated the tranquility of passions daily gratified, and beneath their gentle manners was visible that particular brutality imparted by domination in rather easy things, in which one&#8217;s strength is exerted and one&#8217;s vanity tickled - the handling of thoroughbred hourses and the company of fallen women.</p></blockquote>

<p>How good is your life? Add up your experiences and your accomplishments and the particular details of your life as what the story is about. Being alive per se it has no value. Life itself is a container which we fill with various goods or bads. And deciding how valuable it is, how good it is for me to be alive is a matter of adding up the value of the contents of the life. <strong>But the container itself is a mere container. It has no value in and of itself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Neutrual container theory</strong> - only about pain and pleasure, mere container is a neutral.</p>

<p><strong>Valuable container theory</strong> - Life itself is worth having. There&#8217;s benefit to me above and beyond the question of what&#8217;s going on within my life (am I loved, am I accomplishing things, am I having nice experiences or not) but we need to remember mere fact that I&#8217;m alive gives my life some value.</p>

<p>How much extra add valueble container? Modest versions of the valuable container theory say, although being alive per se is good, if the contents of your life get bad enought, that <strong>can outweigh the value of being alive</strong> so that the grand total is negative.</p>

<p>Against it thinks being alive per se is so incredibly valuable that no matter how horrible the contents are, the <strong>grand total will always be positive</strong>. (fantastic valuable container theory)</p>

<p>The centrual bad thing about to die is the fact that because I&#8217;ll be dead I&#8217;ll be deprived of the good things in life. This is not the only bad thing, there are other features of death, as we experience it, that are separable from the deprivation account.</p>

<p>If we see it can not go any other way we don&#8217;t have to feel bad about it. 2 + 2 always equal 4. Spinoza.</p>

<p>would it be better to know when you were going to die? Because of unpredictability it&#8217;s difficult to make right kinds of plans. And in particular, it&#8217;s hard to know how to pace youself. It can work the other way as well, you make a life plan and then you don&#8217;t die yet, you continue to stick around and then your life has this feeling anticlimitic.</p>

<p>The overall shape of you life matters (the narrative arc of your life)</p>
