<blockquote><p>In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. Communist Manifesto</p></blockquote>

<p>1848 - 1852 what Marx experiences is a period of great disillusion.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.</p>

<p>The present generation is like the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It now only has a new world to conquer, it must go under in order to make room for the men who are able to cope with a new world. The Class Struggles in France</p></blockquote>

<p>Febraury revolution most the beautiful revolution, it was when everybody was the brother and sisters were all fighting for the same cause. But later on in June of 1848 you get the ugly revoltion. The workers are in the streets of Paris, saying, we want jobs, we want food, we want wages, will allowe us to live well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called June Day.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Febraury revolution was the beautiful revolution, the revolution of universal sympathy, because the contradictions which erupted in it against the monarchy were still undeveloped and peacefully dormant, because the social struggle which formed their background had only achieved an ephemeral existence, and existence in phrases, in words. The June revoulution is the ugly revolution, the nasty revolution, because the phrases have given place to the real thing&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>The <strong>realy real</strong> for Marx is class strugle. After the revolution 1848 the realy real become <strong>economic law</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>What taste! What cuisine! What wines! And what speeches! Nothing could make me more scornful of success, considering the price at which it is purchased. I sat unmoved, nauseated by the patriotic fervor they whipped up with mealy platitudes such as &#8216;the abyss toward which we are running&#8217; the &#8216;honor of our flag,&#8217; the &#8216;shadow cast by our standards,&#8217; the &#8216;fraternity of peoples.&#8217; Never will there be a quarter as many ovations for the most beautiful works of the masters. <strong>Flaubert</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1>From metaphysic to value theory</h1>

<p>when somebody dies - it&#8217;s hard for the rest of us.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re thinking about the central badness of death, it seems to me that we&#8217;ve got to focus on my being dead. What is it about my being dead that&#8217;s bad for me? When I dead, I&#8217;m not exist.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s bad because while you&#8217;re doing this, you&#8217;re not getting something better. Example, stay home and watch something on TV. How it could be bad for me? It&#8217;s a pleasant enought way to spend a half an hour, on the other hand, suppose what I could be doing instead of watching a half an hour of television is being at a really great party.</p>

<p>In this case the fact I stayed at home watching TV is bad for me in this comparative sense. It&#8217;s not in itself an unpleasant way to spend some time. It&#8217;s just there&#8217;s a better way to spend time that I could invest in something else. <em>Theres a lack of the better good</em></p>

<p>A lack is not intrinsically bad, but it&#8217;s still a kind of bad in this second sense. <em>To be lacking a good is itself bad for me.</em></p>

<p>So, nonexistence is bad by virtue of the opportunity costs that are involved. When I don&#8217;t exist I&#8217;m not getting the things that I could have otherwise gotten, if only I were still alive. <strong>Death is bad because it deprives me of the good things in life</strong></p>

<p>How could it be that death is bad for me when I don&#8217;t exist?</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Something can be bad for you only if you exist</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re dead you don&#8217;t exist
=> C. Death can&#8217;t be bad for you.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not then concern either the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no more. <strong>Epicurus</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Modest version</strong> A. Something can be bad for you, only if you exist at sometime or the other. (dead can be bad for me)
<strong>Bolder claim</strong> B. Something can be bad for you, only if you exist at the same time as that thing. (then bad can&#8217;t be bad for you)</p>
