	<div class="entry-content"><p>About Marx and his teacher Hegel.</p>

<p>Hegel is the most important philosopher in up until his time.</p>

<blockquote><p>The only Thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of Reason; that Reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process. Hegel, Lecture on the Philosophy of History</p></blockquote>

<p>The only place where you can find the truth is in the world, in history.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reason is the substance of the Universe; viz. that by wchi and in which all reality has its being and subsistence. On the other hand, it is the Infinite Energy of the Universe&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Modernity for Hegel is the period in which we understand that the only place we should look for truth is right around us, not in some divine (божественный) or ideal realm.</p>

<blockquote><p>In traversing the past we have only to do with what is present&#8230; The life of the ever present Spitir is a circle of progressive embodiments, which looked at in one aspect still exist beside each other, and only looked at from another point of view appear as past.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dialectical processes are how the past is retained in the present.</p>

<h1>Thesis | Antithesis => Synthesis</h1>

<p>Fathers | Sons => Synthesis or opposit of it - Negation</p>

<hr />

<p>Conflict makes the world go round. History is reasonable. Truth is in the flesh of history, Hegel takes it from being the flesh of Jesus, to being the stuff of history. That&#8217;s the only realm where truth is found. So you can&#8217;t isolate youself and try to find the truth, truth is on the battlefield, in politics, on the streets, the <strong>truth will emerge in history</strong>. That is Hegel&#8217;s strong belieive.</p>

<blockquote><p>The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom; a progress whose development according to the necessity of its nature it is our business to investigate. Hegel</p>

<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Communist Manifesto</p>

<p>On the basis of political economy itself, in its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the most wretched (несчастный) of commodities; that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production&#8230; Marx</p></blockquote>

<p>That creates self-estrangement or alienation. Create more and more, but get less and less, because prices go down and that&#8217;s the problem for workers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.</p></blockquote>

<p>Through your work you see more about yourself, you learn about yourself, from the work you do. Marx says that happenes in capitalism when I make something, it&#8217;s not mine, somebody else takes it away immediately. I make something and the more I make, the more it&#8217;s somebody esle&#8217;s and so by working, I lose myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ivan Ilych&#8217;s case is very typical, most of at fundamental level don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re going to die.</p>

<p>When people have these near brushes with death, it&#8217;s easy to velieve that the fact of their mortality is more vivid. It&#8217;s something before their eye. And they after that can say, I need to change my life, I need to spent less time at the office and more time with my family, telling the people that I love them, doint the things that are important to me, spending less time to worry about getting ahead, making money, getting the plasma TV.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say when we find the fact of our mortailty is made vivid, when we change our priorites.</p>

<h2>The claim about everybody dies alone</h2>

<p>Nobody can die your death for you, nobody can take your part. It doesn&#8217;t express very clearly. But what about the cases when person die in car acident in the middle of conversation. He die very fast and seems to me in this case we can say he dies alone, it was very fast.</p>

<p>But what about Socrates? He was not lonely. Hume died, had illines, he used to talk about various matters with friends, he was cheefrul and pleasent to the end. And here is no reason at all to believe that he was feeling lonely.</p>

<h1>Is Death Bad?</h1>

<p>When I die I ceased to exists. We want to turn to ethical question about death. Why is death bad? How death can be death?</p>

<p>Value questions. How and in what ways the death is bad? Is death bad? What makes it bad?</p>

<p>John&#8217;s death is bad for John&#8217;s friends and family. When somebody dies, we lose the chance to continue interacting with a person.</p>

<p><strong>How could it be true that death is bad for the person that dies?</strong></p>
