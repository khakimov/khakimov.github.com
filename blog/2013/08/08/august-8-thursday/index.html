	<div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Everything begins to change in appearance&#8230; The more they see one another, the less they can do without seeing one another still more. A tender and sweet sentiment steals into the soul, and at the least obstacle becomes an impetuous frenzy; jealousy awakens together with love; Discord triumphs, and the greatest of all passions receives sacrifices of human blood. Discourse on Inequality</p></blockquote>

<p>We begin to act for each other, we want to appear the way we want to be seen which is a departure from how we just act naturally.</p>

<blockquote><p>Everyone began to look at everyone else and to wish to be looked at himself, and public esteem acquired a value&#8230; The fermentation caused by these new leavens eventually produced <strong>compounds fatal to happiness and innocence</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>When we begin to want to appear in a certain way for the other, we begin to be fakers, we begin to be hypocrites. <strong>We begin to leave who we really were and begin to try to be something for somebody else.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We want to be someone who we are not just so we can please another.</strong> We need things like luxuries, but they don&#8217;t seem like luxuries anymore, we need those things to be who we think we are.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;since these conveniences, by becoming habitual, had almost entirely ceased to be enjoyable, and at the same time degenerated into true needs, it became much more cruel to be deprived of them than to possess them was sweet, and men were unhappy to lose them without being happy to possess them.</p></blockquote>

<p>You deisre something, and when you get it, after awhile you don&#8217;t get any pleasure from it, but if you lose it - it causes you pain. <strong>Become more vulnerable to pain</strong>. As you acquire luxuries, you become more vulnerable to pain, because the luxuries you acquire after a while you get, just get habituated to them, they become just part of your life and you don&#8217;t get pleasure from them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Although men now had less endurance, and natural pity had already undergone some modification, this period in the development of the human faculties, occupying a just mean <strong>between</strong> indolence of the primitive state and the petulant activity of our vanity, must have been the happiest and the logest-lasting epoch. &#8230; <em>the real youth of the world</em>&#8230;</p>

<p>Lacking valid resons to justify and sufficient strength to defend himself&#8230; the rich, under the pressure of necessity, at last conceived the most well-considered project ever to enter man&#8217;s mind; to use ven his atackers forces in his favor, to make his adversaries his defenders, to instill in them other maxims and to give them different institutions as favorable to himself as natural Right was contrary to him.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the rich create a scheme to get the poor to defend property.</p>

<blockquote><p>All ran toward their chains in the belief that they were securing their freedom; for while they had enought reason to sense the advantages of a political establishment, they had not enough experience to foresee its dangers.</p></blockquote>

<p>It creates a situation where the rest of society wants to emulate the rich, tries to become rich, corrupting themselves even further. So on the one hand, they suffer because they&#8217;re poor, and then they suffer in the soul becuase they think that the key to salvation is the acquisition of wealth, becoming superior to other people.</p>

<p>Rich people are so sentitive, because you can hurt, they protect their fancy castles, fancy clothes, they have so many ways in which they invested in luxuries, that they are sensitive in every part of their goods.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Natural love of freedom</h2>

<blockquote><p>Man&#8217;s natural dispositions for or against servitude must therefore not be judged by the degradation of enslaved Peoples but by the prodigious (огромный) feats (подвиги) of all free Peoples to protect themselves against oppression (угнетение).</p>

<p>Animals &#8230; born free and abhorring captivity smash their heads against the bars of their prison.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rich people are happy because of the existence of the poor. That the wealth itself doesn&#8217;t mean that much to them, but what means something to them is that they could look at other people and feel superior to them. Rich like having that much food because the other people are starving.</p>

<blockquote><p>That indeed, is the genuine cause of all these differences: the Savage lives in himself; sociable man, always outside himself, is capable of living only in the opinion of others and, so to speak, derives the sentiment of his own existence solely from their judgment.</p></blockquote>

<p>We want to be seen in a certain way by other people.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is manifestly against the Law of Nature, however defined, that a child command an old man, an imbecile lead a wise man, and a handful of people abound in superfluities while the starving multitude lacks in necessities.</p>

<p>Voltaire writes: I have received, sir, your new book agains the human species, and I thank you for it&#8230; No one has ever been so witty as you are in trying to turn us into brutes: to read your book makes one long to go on all fours. Since, however, it is now some sixty years since I gave up the practice, I feel it is unfortunately imposible for me to resume it: I leave this natural habit to those more fit for it than are you and I.</p></blockquote>
