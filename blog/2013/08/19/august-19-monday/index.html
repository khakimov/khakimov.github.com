<h1>The Value of Life</h1>

<p>Example with rat and orgasmic impulse, when they stop eat and having sex except but clicking button with this impulses. Why we could not imagine doing same thing with us? <strong>There&#8217;s something that distinguishes humans from rats.</strong> No doubt you would enjoy it for a very long time. But I imagine that after a period, part of you is going to start asking, &#8220;Huh, say, it feels the same as it was yesterday and the day before that and the day before that.&#8221; I imagine this is how it&#8217;s going to feel tomorrow, and the day after that and the day after that. And eventually this question would start, <strong>&#8220;is this really all there is to life, just simple pleasure like this?&#8221;</strong> You are not just going to stay caught in the moment. You&#8217;re going to take this meta-level or higher level standpoint, look down at the pleasure and wonder, &#8220;Is this all that there is to life?&#8221; and this question will override the pleasure, <strong>eventually, you&#8217;d become hirrified that you were, in effect, stuck in this rat-like existence.</strong></p>

<p>Immortality can&#8217;t be something desirable, it would be a nightmare, something you would long to free yourself from.</p>

<p>So parhaps the best form of life would be not immortality; and not what we&#8217;ve got now, where you live after a mere drop of 50 or 80 or 100 years. But rather the best thing I suppose would be to be able to live as long as you wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Is it worth continuing to live or is it not wort continuing to live?</strong></p>

<p>good life vs bad life?</p>

<p>The things that are worth having for their own sake, philosophers call <strong>intrinsically valuable</strong>. Instrumentally good or bad things in the list about good vs bad life.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s worth having for its own sake?</strong> Well, one natural suggestion is that pleasure (intrinsically good) is worth having for its own sake and pain (intrinsically bad) is probably worth avoiding for its own sake.</p>

<p>Hedonism is a view that many people are attracted to, it&#8217;s got a very simple theory of the nature of wellbeing. Being well of is a matter of experiencing pleasure and avoiding or minimizing the expirience of pain.</p>

<p>In deciding whether what life holds for you is worth having, better than nothing, you, roughly speaking, add up all the good times and substract all the bad times and see whether the net balance is positive or negative.</p>

<p><strong>Add up all the pleasures, subtract all the pains.</strong></p>

<p>If only I had chosen to become a doctor, instead of having chosen to become a lawyer. How much better off or worse off would I have been? Or if I decide to become an artice or a scholar or a beach bum or a farmer, how much better off or worse off would I have been? You&#8217;re trying to project your future and asking the question &#8220;Where do I think I&#8217;d be better off?&#8221;, which of these branches that are available to me, the branches of my life story which is the one in which the future from here on our holds more pleasure and holds less pain. That&#8217;s how hedonist will think about choises.</p>

<p>We can evaluate this year, or 6 month, or just this evening. I can talk about, well, what should I do tonight? Shoild I stay home and work on my paper? Should I go to the party? Where will I be better off tonight?</p>

<p>We do our evaluation not for the entire lives, but of chunk of lives. That what we can do if we&#8217;re accept hedonism. <strong>Should we accept hedonism?</strong></p>

<p>Robert Nozick, a philosopher who died a few years ago. Nizick invited us to imagine an experience machine, that&#8217;s offer us not just simple rat-machine with impulses to generate pleasure in our brain, he offers, basically, completely realistic virtual reality. When you are hooked up to the machine, it seems to you exactly the same on the inside as it would seem to you if you really were.</p>

<p>You coud have the identical experience of climbing Mount Everest, you&#8217;d feel the wind bracing you. You feel the thrill of having made it to the top and the wind bracingly striking your chin and you feel the satisfaction and you&#8217;ve got the memories of having almost died. Or <strong>write the great american novel</strong> then you&#8217;ve got the experience of staying up late at night not knowing how to make the plot work out, crushing pieces of paper and throwing them away. Or you want to be <strong>finding the cure for cancer</strong>. So you&#8217;ve got exactrly the experience you would have if you were working in your lab having the brilliant breakthrough when you finally realize what the combination is that would make the right antibody. That&#8217;s life on the experience machine. You&#8217;re not doing any of it, you just floating in the lab. But the experience are <strong>identical</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, ask youself then, would you want to spend your life hooked up to the experience machine? How would you feel if you discovered now that you have been living your life hooked up to an experience machine? <strong>Is it the best possible form of human existence?</strong></p>
