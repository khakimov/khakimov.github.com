	<div class="entry-content"><p>Lucretious says, look, most of us are upset and anxious at the fact that we&#8217;re going to die. We think death is bad for us. There&#8217;ll be this period after my death in which I won&#8217;t exist. And deprivation account helps us to say why it&#8217;s bad, because during this period of nonexistence, you&#8217;re not enjoying the good things in life. But wait a minute, <em>the period after you die isn&#8217;t the only period during which you don&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s not the only period in which if only you were still alive, you could still be enjoying the good things in life. There&#8217;s another period of nonexistence.</em> <strong>It&#8217;s the period before my birth</strong></p>

<p>It is bad? Lucretius says that&#8217;s silly, nobody upset about the fact that there was an eternity before they were born.</p>

<p>Before born you don&#8217;t life, but with death you lost it. So, we can say, that we care about that part after death more than the one before birth. <strong>Because the one after death involves loss, and the one before birth does not.</strong></p>

<p>We imaging to living the longer life. But what is it that happens when I say, if only I&#8217;d been born earlier? Well, says <strong>Feldman</strong>, you don&#8217;t actually imagine a longer life, you just shift the entire life and start it earlier. When we imaging being born earlier we don&#8217;t imaging having longer life. Nothing better about having a life earlier, according to the deprivation account.</p>

<p>So, Feldman says, no wonder, no surprise that you care about the nonexistence after death. Because when you imagine that being different, you imagine a longer life. But when you start thinking about the nonexistence before birth and you imagine that being different, you don&#8217;t imagine more goods in life, you just imagine them taking place at a different time.</p>

<p>Derek Parfit says, it&#8217;s true that when I think about the nonexistence after I die that&#8217;s loss, whereas the nonexistence before I&#8217;m born, that&#8217;s not loss, that&#8217;s mere &#8220;schmoss&#8221;. And it&#8217;s true that we need an explanation about why loss is worse than &#8220;schmoss&#8221;. But we can see that this is not an arbitrary preference on our part, because in fact, it&#8217;s part of a quite general pattern we have of caring about the future in a way that we don&#8217;t care about the past. <strong>This is a very deep fact about human caring. We are oriented towards the future and concerned about what happens in it, in a way that we&#8217;re not oriented and concerned about what happened in the past.</strong></p>

<p>Parfit&#8217;e got a very nice example, imagine that you&#8217;ve got some condition, some sort of medical condition that will kill you unless you have an operation. So fair enought, you&#8217;re going to have the operation. This will allow you to live your life. Unfortunately in order to perfom the operation, they can&#8217;t have you anesthetized. You have to be awayke, perhaps in order to tell the surgeon &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s where it hurts,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a very painful operation. Only one thing we can do is this: give a super local medication and you will not remember anything about the operation itself (24 hours completely wiped out). So you&#8217;re in the hospital and you wake up and you ask yourself, &#8220;Huh, have I had the operation yet or not?&#8221; Don&#8217;t know, right? So you ask the nurse, &#8220;Have I had the operation yet or not?&#8221; She says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, we have a couple on the hall today who are some of whom have had it and some of whom are scheduled to have it later today. Let me go look at your file, I&#8217;ll come back and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221; I want it to be the case that I&#8217;m one of the people who&#8217;s already had the operation. I don&#8217;t want to be one of the people who hasn&#8217;t yet had the operation. <strong>We want the pain to be in the past.</strong> We care more about what&#8217;s happening in the futer than we care about what&#8217;s happening in the past.</p>
