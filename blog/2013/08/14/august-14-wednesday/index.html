	<div class="entry-content"><p>So the worker the more he works, the more he feels outside himself or that he has lost himself by producing something. But for Marx, when we produce things we see ourselves in what we make, we see a reflection of ourselves that increases our understanding. But in industrial world we see our own alienation, our own distance from ourselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>The worker therefore only feels himself ourside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home&#8230; Lastly, the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else&#8217;s&#8230;</p>

<p>As a result, therefore, man (the worker) only feels himself freely active in his animal functions - eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc; and in his human fuctuons he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marx means that what is truly human about us is our ability to do creative work, we plane, we create and that now (with industrialization) becomes what makes us feel like an animal, like we&#8217;re controlled by others. And we feel free when we do animal functions - eat, sleep, procreate, when we should feel most free when we work.</p>

<blockquote><p>The object of labor is, therefore, the objection of man&#8217;s speciess-life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he sees himself in a world that he has created. In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labor tears from him his species-life&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Our species-life is that we are able to see ourselves in the creative work we do.</p>

<p>Even as we work more and more, we become further and further away from who we should be or who we might become. That&#8217;s a contradiction for Marx. <strong>We&#8217;re living like animals even if we have a greater capacity to be human. That should create a synthesis, that&#8217;s the revolution for Marx.</strong></p>

<p>Dialectic can&#8217;t persist forever, because truth emerges in history, history has to resolve contradictions. Marx says, that when the worker realizes that the worker is oppressed and has to control his own labor, that liberates everyone. That show everyone that the work we do should be our own.</p>

<p>The working class for Marx is the vehicle for the resolution of historical contradictions. And when the worker class will resolve this contradtiction, all the rest of us can wake up, and we can see those contradictions resolved too.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the relationship of estranged labor to private property it follows further that the emancipation (освобождение) of society from private property, etc, from servitude, is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workes; not that their emancipation alone is at stake, but because the emacipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Bourgeosie, the middle class, a most revolutionaty class.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers. Communist Manifesto.</p>

<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggless.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s bourgeoisie reveal that it&#8217;s economic contradiction that forces people to do things they would otherwise find abhorrent (отвратительный).</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.</p>

<p>All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable (почтенный) prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify (окостеневать). All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relation with his kind.</p></blockquote>

<p>bourgeoisie shows the &#8220;real&#8221; conditions of life, and that for Marx is economic exploitation. That behind marriage is economic exploitation, behind patriarchy is economic exploitation, behind the economy, behind the government. The real conditions of life are alienation and economic exploitation, that once revealed, will make people want to change the conditions of their lives.</p>
