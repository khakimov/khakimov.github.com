	<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>The legend of Peugeot company</strong> What is it? Maybe you can say it is cars that Peugeot manufactories, but it seems wrong because Peugeot company is not the same as the Peugeot cars. Maybe you can say it is factories and showrooms, but it is not. So perhaps Peugeot is the people who work in the factories and in the offices? It&#8217;s clearly not true. Peugeot is a story, it is a fiction, something that we invented, it belongs to a particular kind of fictions which is called limited liability companies.</p>

<p>Hoc est corpus meum. (this is my body)</p>

<p>How to convince millions of people, strangers to one another to believe the same stories about gods or about limited liability companies or about nations or about human rights? It helps sapiens to manage millions of strangers to cooperate towards common goals.</p>

<p><strong>Imagined reality</strong> is something that everybody believes in and as long as this common belief persists, the imagined reality is a real force in the world.</p>

<p>Dual reality - on the on hand there is the objective reality of revirs and trees and lions, on the other hand there is the imagined reality of gods and nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became more and more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers and trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as goods and nations and corporations.</p>

<h1>Charles Darwin</h1>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s difficult to believe in the dreadful but quiet war lurking just below the serene facade of nature. Charles Darwin, 1839</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Utilitarianism</strong> it&#8217;s the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong&#8230;</p>

<p>Romanticism versus Utalitarianism. For romantics we make the world as we live in it.</p>

<p>Joshua Mill said that romanticism saved him. Joshua Mill was a prodigy child, he learned Greek by the age of three, high level mathematics by four or five, various languages and then he had a nervous breakdown, he has crisis.</p>

<p>You can do what you want as long as it doesn&#8217;t hurt someone else. This notion of liberty is key for modern political thought</p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose that all your objects in life were realized&#8230; would this be a joy and happiness to you? And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered &#8220;No!&#8221; At this my heart sank within me; the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down. John Stuart Mill, Autobiography</p></blockquote>

<p>And then he read about melancholy and dejection, and he says, these people know about life. They don&#8217;t say oh, you should flip a coin or go and take a class. These people actually explore their experience of sadness as a way of deepening their lives and creating art. And Mill wanted to create a bridge between utilitarianism and this romanticism. And the rest of his life he focused on building a philosophy that combines attention to utility, attention to calculation, but also attention to organic community, attention to the whole.</p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s problem. Why is there variety? Species are not permanent. Darwin went to investigate nature, he says, I&#8217;ve got to look, and I&#8217;ve got to collect. He went on famous voyage on the ship Beagles, from 1831 to 1836.</p>

<blockquote><p>This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a flucuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic. On the Origin of Species</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Origin of Species</strong> is published in 1859.</p>

<h1>Fear of Death</h1>

<p>In what circumstances, or in what ways, should we behave one way rather than another? Kafka, for example, said the meaning of life is the fact that it ends. Cryptic, as usually for Kafka, but suggestion, is a fairly common one, it&#8217;s something deep about how we should live, that we&#8217;re going to die, that our life will come to an end. How should we respond to that fact?</p>

<p>Emotional response. Fear. Terror of death. Is fear of death a rationally appropriate response? resonable emotion?</p>

<p>Under what conditions does it make sense to be proud of something? First of all, the thing that you&#8217;re proud of has to be some kind of accomplishment. Something that it makes sense for you to be proud of it, it&#8217;s got to be in some way an accomplishment that reflects well on you.</p>

<p>Conditions number <strong>one</strong> - in order to feel <strong>fear</strong> it has to <strong>be bad</strong>. Fear requires something bad, as the object of your fear. Conditions number <strong>two</strong> - there&#8217;s should be nonnegligible chance of the bad state of affairs happening, <strong>of the bad object coming to you</strong>. Fear by mauled to death by tigers doesn&#8217;t make any sense.
Conditions number three - we need to have a cerain amount of uncertainty in order to have fear be appropriate. Where the bad thing will occur and/or how bad the bad thing will be.</p>

<p>First thing you might worry about the death is the process of dying. Then afraid just being dead, but it&#8217;s not appropriate in that case because you&#8217;re guaranteed that you&#8217;re going to die and this is not nonegligible chance. Is being dead intrinsically a bad thing? It doesn&#8217;t seem to me that it is. The only thing you could be afraid of is that you might die too soon, earlier rather than later.</p>

<p>Maybe <strong>anger</strong> is appropriate response? Anger itself has appropriateness conditions. In order for anger to make sense, well, here&#8217;s condition that make sense.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s got to be directed at a person. It has control over whatever he/she doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Anger makes sense only when the agent has wronged you, has treated you in a way that it was morally inappropriate in a way to treat you. If your rommate has been doing things that you don&#8217;t like, but they haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, anger doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe I should just be sad at the fact that I&#8217;m going to die to soon and some emotions does make sense. The world&#8217;s a wonderful place and it would be better to have more of it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s extraordinarily lucky of us to be in this select, fortunate few. Not fear, not anger, we need to be gradidute to be alive at all.</p>

<p>Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s book - Cat&#8217;s Cradle</p>
