For if thought is like the keyboard of a piano, divided into so many notes, or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty-six letters all in order, then his splendid mind had one by one, firmly and accurately, until it had reached, say, the letter Q. He reached Q. Very few people in the whole of England ever reach Q&#8230; But after Q? What comes next?</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Web of love</strong> connects one with the other, not a logical deduction, but an intimacy born of affection and art.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the meaning of life? That was all - a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.</p></blockquote>

<h2>There is No Justice in History. Part 4</h2>

<p>The most common theory, which tries to explain the patriarchal system, points out that men are physically stronger than women and that men have used the greater physical force, physical power to force women into submission. That means men could monopolize certain economic tasks that demand hard manual labor, like plowing the fields and harvesting wheat or rice or whatever it is. And this gave men <strong>control of food production</strong> and gave them control of the economy which in turned translated into political power.</p>

<p>Problems of this theory: First of all the statement that men are stronger than women is true only on average and also it is true only with regard to certain types of strngths. Secondly, and more importantly, there simple is no direct relation between physical strength and social power smong homo sapiens, among humans.</p>

<p>Another theory explains that the dominance of men over women results not just from strength, but from something which is more complacted, <strong>from aggression</strong>. According to this theory, for millions of years of evolution, men have been evloving to become willing to engage in physical violence much more than women, and this is why throughout history warfare was a monopoly of mainly of men. Men -> war -> control civil society</p>

<p>Now recent studies indeed indicate that the hormonal and cognitive systems of men and women are somewhat different and that men, by nature, becuse of that more violent, more willing to use physical violence against others and therefore men are really better suited to serve as common soldiers than women.</p>

<p>The third most common theory for the rise of patriacrchal societies explain that through millions of years of evolution men and women evolved different survival and reproduction strategies. Men, competed with one another, for access to fetile women, for the opportunity to impregnate the women; therefore, if you wre a man your chance of reproducing and passing your genes to the next generation, depended above all on your ability to defeat other men, and to outperfom other men. A women on the other hand had no problem finding a man that was willing to impregnate her. However if the woman wanted her children to provide her with grandchildren she needed to carry them in her womb for nine long months and then nurture them and take care of them for years because it was not enought just to be impregnated. During all that time of pregnancy and child care woman had fewer opportunities to obtain food and woman reguired a lot of help. In order to ensure the survival of yourself and your children woman need a man.</p>

<p>According to this theory, as time went by, the feminine genes that made it to the next generation therefore belonged to the woman who were the most submissive caretakes, who agreed to everything the man wanted and who spent most of the time just taking care of the children. <em>The result of these different survival strategies according to the theory is that men have been programmed by millions of years of evolution to be ambitious and competitive and to excel in politics and business and so forth.</em></p>
