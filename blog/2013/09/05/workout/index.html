<p><strong>First</strong>, know your maxes for the four lifts</p>

<ul>
<li>squat</li>
<li>bench</li>
<li>deadlift</li>
<li>standing military press</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>How?</strong> Take 80%-85% of your supposed max and perfom as many reps ass possible. Then plug the reps and the weight into this formula to get your estimated 1RM:</p>

<p><strong>Weight * Reps * 0.0333 + Weight = Estimated 1RM</strong></p>

<p>Take 90% of this number and use this as your &#8221;<em>max</em>&#8221; for the <strong>first 4 weeks of the training cycle</strong>. For example, let&#8217;s say I have a 300 deadlift, 220 squat, 180 bench press and 100 military press, then my numbers would look like this:</p>

<p>Deadlift: 300 * 0.9 = 270
Squat: 220 * 0.9 = 198
Bench: 180 * 0.9 = 162
Military press: 100 * 0.9 = 90</p>

<h1>Week 1</h1>

<p>65% * 5 reps, 75% * 5 reps, 85% * 5 or more reps</p>

<h1>Week 2</h1>

<p>70% * 3 reps, 80% * 3 reps, 90% * 3 or more reps</p>

<h1>Week 3</h1>

<p>75% * 5 reps, 85% * 3 reps, 95% * 1 or more reps</p>

<h1>Week 4</h1>

<p>40% * 5 reps, 50% * 5 reps, 65% * 5</p>

<h1>Warming up</h1>

<p>1 * 5 40%
1 * 5 50%
1 * 3 60%
