	<div class="entry-content"><p>Darwin understands the variations are transmitted and controlled through the breeding process and he understands that in nature something like that process takes place too.</p>

<p>The human race is not the goal of evolution, it is one of the products of evolution. The tree of evolution, Darwin says, and is without a trunk.</p>

<blockquote><p>How fleeting are the wishes and effors of man! How short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder, then, that nature&#8217;s productions should be far &#8216;truer&#8217; in character than man&#8217;s productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship? On the Origin of Species</p></blockquote>

<p>Biogeography
Paleontology - geologic periods
Embryology - embryonic development
Morphology - studies the form and structure of something without consideration of the function.</p>

<blockquote><p>In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.</p>

<p>Darwinian selection theory is a two-step process - the production of variation unrelated to the adaptive requirements of the organism, and differential perpetuation of those variations that serve adaptive needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Intelligence is in a adaprive byproduct of evolution. Intelligence was on of those variations that get perpetuated because it helped in the struggle to survive. Morality is an adaptive change through the advantages of living together. Sexual selection depends not on the struggle for existence, but on the struggle between males for the possession of the females.</p>

<blockquote><p>I fully admin that it is atonishing that the females of many birds and some mammals should be endowed with sufficient taste to appreciate ornaments, which we have reason to attribute to sexual selection; and this is even more astonishing in the case of reptiles, fish and insects. The Descent of Man</p>

<p>We thus learn that man is descended from a hairy, tailed quadruped, probably arboreal in its habits, and an inhabitant of the Old World. The Descent Of Man</p></blockquote>

<p>The truth is a compliment you give to the ideas you like. DeGrody</p>

<hr />

<p>Homo sapience is able to change it&#8217;s social, economic, and political behavior very rapidly. Bonobo (dominated by females) and Common Chimpanze (dominated by Alpha Male).</p>

<p>Three teories what happened with Cognitive Revolution starts 70 000 years ago:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>About people being able to share more information about the outside world. About lions, rivers, plan and carry out all kinds of complex actions such as avoiding lion or hunting bison.</p></li>
<li><p>Gossip. Transfer a lot of information not about lions, but about sapiense and the social relationship between Sapiens. It enable Sapiense to live in larger and more cohesive groups up to about 150 individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiction and fiction language. Ability to transmit large quantites of information about things that don&#8217;t really exist at all, like tribal spirits and ghosts. Opens the way for cooperation between very large numbers of strangers. Also it opened the way to the rapid innovation of social behavior.</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Evolutionaty Psychology</h1>

<p><strong>Eating habit.</strong> Obisity results from the conditions under which our ancestors lived 30 or 40 or 50 thousands years ago and their complecated interaction between those conditions and the situation today. 50000 years ago if a woman was walking along the savanna, and suddenly seeing a tree full of ripened fruit, the most sensible thing to do back then was to eat as many of these fruits as quickly as possible for two reasons. First of all <strong>sweet things, things with a lot of sugar in them were very rare in the savannah 50 000 years ago</strong> and the second reason is because somebody else will eat it, so better to it as many of them as possible.</p>

<p>My DNA and psychological urges tell me the same way as my grate parents 50 000 years reacted in the savannah.</p>

<p>Women could have relation with several man and same for man. And no concept marriage for life. Commune raised the childrens.</p>

<p>Collective fatherhood - child could have more than one father.</p>

<hr />

<p>How should we live? We could do it wrong. Mortality rubs our chance do-over.</p>

<p>We have to be careful in our aims and we have to be careful in our execution of our aims, because we have a rather limited amount of time to do it over.</p>

<p>We just don&#8217;t have enought time to flail around, try a little of this, try a little of that. And so what death forces us to do is to be careful. <strong>The face about our death requires paying attention.</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I&#8217;m paying attention, so what should I do with my life? What should I fill it with? What kinds of contents should we try to fill our lives with?</p>

<p>Strategy number one says given that you&#8217;ve only got a finite amount of time, pack as much as you can into life. Given the dangers of failure if you aim too ambitiously, you should settle for the kinds of goals that you&#8217;ve virtually guaranteed that you&#8217;ll accomplish. The pleasure of food, company, sex, ice cream. Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.</p>

<p>Strategy number two says that&#8217;s all well and good, you&#8217;ve got a pretty high chance of succeeding at that. The trouble with strategy number one is the goods that you can achive are small. You might want to write a novel, compose a symphony or marry and raise a family.</p>

<p>Grant me but one good summer, you Powerful Ones!
   And but one autumn, ripening for my song,</p>

<pre><code>  So that my heart, fulfilled by sweet play, 
     Might the more willingly die, contented.
</code></pre>

<p>The soul deprived in life of its godly right
   Won’t rest in Orcus, either, not down below,</p>

<pre><code>  Yet if the sacred boon my heart craves 
     Should in the future succeed—the poem—
</code></pre>

<p>Welcome, then, silence, hail to the world of shades!
   I’ll rest content, even if my lyre and play</p>

<pre><code>  Did not conduct me down there; once I
     Lived as the gods live, and more we don’t need.
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m just deluding myself as well, when I think there&#8217;s something grander, something signigicant, something valuable about having made an accomplishment, having achieved something that continues beyond me.</p>

<p>We live and then we&#8217;re dead is to try to make the life that you&#8217;ve got as good as possible, as valuable as possible, to pack as much into it as you can.</p>

<p><strong>Life is Suffering</strong> - if life isn&#8217;t worth having overall, then its loss is not a bad thing, but a good thing. The trick isn&#8217;t to make life as valuable as it could be, but rather to come to recognize that on balance, life isn&#8217;t positive, but negative.</p>

<p>Buddhist believe if you think hard about the underlying nature of life, you&#8217;ll see that everyplace there is loss. <strong>Life is suffering.</strong></p>
