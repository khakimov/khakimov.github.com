	<div class="entry-content"><h2>Sex, Death, Aggression and Guilt</h2>

<p>Freud is father of psychoanalysis, at the end of the 19th century writing mostly in Vienna. For today we will discuss his work Civilization ands its Discontents.</p>

<p>He focused on this early on in his career, because he felt that the stories he kept hearing from his patients invariably came back to questions of desire. <strong>Free association</strong> that is when the psychoanalysis says &#8220;okay, what&#8217;s the first thing that comes into your mind&#8221; and you say something quickly <strong>before</strong> you have a chance to <strong>censor yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>Before Freud came to that idea of free association, he was a hypnotist.</p>

<p>By the end of 1890 Freud changed his mind about child abusing in families. Instead of thinking these people have been abused, he starts to think, in fact, what people are remembering is their desore. That they can&#8217;t act on.</p>

<p>So Freud starts listining to those stories of thwarted or twisted frustrated desire. And he starts to theorize that what hist patients are suffering from is <strong>the past</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Our hysterical patients suffer from reminiscences. Their symptoms are the remnants and the memory symbols of certain (traumatic) experience. <strong>The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>And by understanding history we have a better chance to live a life that&#8217;s less suffereing and more possibilities for happines and love and work.</p>

<p>Repression is key for Freud because that is the mechanism that explains why you need interpretation. The self is divided in Freud, unlike Rosseau, who thought you have to fight to use the true self hidden under all the disguises. In Freud, the true self is not just one thing, it&#8217;s a contratictory, set of forces and out desires are not uniform, even when we get underneath.</p>

<p>Freud theorizes that as infants, really, as very small children, we begin to look for things to satisfy our elemntal craving Things. But we look for things, that are associated with those elemental cravings and never actually look for the thing that the nourishment (питание, пища, поддержка) that we crave directly.</p>

<p><strong>You continue to search for your fantasies to satisfy your biology.</strong> And when you find something that really does satisfy it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s something you were searching for before. Not the thing itself but something fantastic, some imaginary construct of what you originally biologically instinctively crave.</p>

<blockquote><p>The finding of an object is in fact a refinding of it. Three Essays on the Theory of Secuality</p></blockquote>

<p>He means is when we discover something we really love, we say, gosh I finally found what I really love. It&#8217;s actially some repetition of Something we fantasized about before. Something, that we perhaps, thought we lost before. And, continue to search for things, that are rooted in our histories.</p>

<h2>Building Pyramids</h2>

<p>In order to build large cities, kindgoms and empires, more food is of course a necessary condition but it is not a sufficient condition. The mere fact that you can feed 10000 people in the same town or a million doesnt guarantee that they can agree how to divide this food, land and water, how to settle disputes and conflicts. And how to act in times of crisis like drought (засуха) or war.</p>

<p>Sapiens had to rely on <strong>inventing</strong> all kinds of stories, new imagined realities that could regulate cooperation on such a huge scale. Farmers began to weave stories that eventually enable millions of strangers to cooperate together. If we go back to around 8500 BC, we will find that the largest settlements in the world were villages such as <strong>Jercho</strong> which could take a few hundres invidiuals at most. By 3000 BC, you could already find cities and kindoms ruling tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people. And then Roman empire in the Mediterranean region, and the Han empire in China (millions of people). This cities, kindoms and empires were based on the belief on common emergent realities.</p>

<p><strong>Imagined order</strong> - means that the social and legal norms, that sustained these kindoms and empires, and kept their society stable, were base not on some natural instincts and not on personal acquaintance, rather they were based on belief in share stories, shared imagined realities.</p>

<p>We hold these truth to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pusuit of Happiness.</p>

<p>Remix from bilogist point of view:</p>

<p>We hold these truth to be self-evident, that all men are <em>envolved different</em>, that they are <em>born</em> with certain <em>mutable traits</em>, that among these are Life, and the pusuit of <em>Pleasure</em>.</p>

<h2>Arguments Markers</h2>

<p><em>I am tall, and I am good at sport.</em></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><em>I am tall, so I am good at sports.</em></p>

<p>When you use the word <strong>and</strong>, you&#8217;re simply stating the two facts. But when you use the word <strong>so</strong> (therefore, thus, hence, accordingly), you&#8217;re indicating that one of them is a <em>reson</em> for the other.</p>

<p>Kinds of argument markers:</p>

<p>Conclusion markers: <strong>so, therefore, thus, accordingly</strong>, they indicate that the sentece right after them is a conclusion.</p>

<p>After the words <strong>because, for, as, for the reason that, and the reason why</strong> are a reason or a premise. And we going to call it a reason marker, or a premise marker.</p>
