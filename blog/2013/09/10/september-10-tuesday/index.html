<h2>History&#8217;s Biggest Fraud</h2>

<p>If things were so good at the time of the hunter gatherers, why did the agricultural revolution happen?</p>

<p>For the first 2.5 millin years of their existence, human managed very well without agriculture. They fed themselves by gathering plant and by hunting animals that lived and bread <strong>without</strong> much human intervention.</p>

<p>About <strong>12 000 years ago</strong> sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to manipulate the lives of a few animal and plant species. Like wheat or potatoes or chicken or cows, from sunrise to sunset, sewed seeds and watered plants, and plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to pasture.</p>

<p>That leads to the agricultural revolution, transition from a life of hunting and gathering to a life of controlling and cultivation plants and animals ofccured for the first time around <strong>9000 BC</strong> in southeastern Turkey, western Iran and Levant (scholars once believed that agriculture began only this area in the Middle East and from there spread all around the world, but this theory is <strong>no longer accepted</strong>. Today scholars agree, that agriculture sprang up in several different parts of the world independently).</p>

<p>Agricultural revoltion was a great leap forward for human kind. It&#8217;s wrong to think that the agricultural revoltion began because people became smarter and discovered things about animals and plants that they didn&#8217;t know before.</p>

<p>Compared with lives of most peasants, the ancient hunter gatherers enjoyed a better life, they enjoyed a healthier diet, they worked fewer hours and they spent their time doing much more interesting things than the peasants. Also they were less in danger of starvation, of disease and probably even less in danger of human violence.</p>

<p>The average peasant in the small village, he or she worked harder than the average forager thousands of years prevously. And they got in return a worse diet. <em>The agricultural revolution from this prospective turns out to be the biggest fraud in history.</em></p>

<p>Meat covers almost 2.25 million square km of the globe&#8217;s surface. How did it turn wheat from being insignificant to be ubiquitous, everywhere? <strong>Wheat did it by manipulating homo sapiens!</strong></p>

<p>The human body is not adapted to all this back breaking toil, to all this clearing rocks and weeding of fields and carrying water buckets from the river. Human body paid for all this effort with a very high price.</p>

<p>Also, people were forced to settle permanently next to the wheat field and this completely changed their way of life. From nomadic foragers, human turned into peasants living in a village in one place. <strong>Wheat domisticated us</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Paintings. We&#8217;re starting off with Eugene Delacroix was born just after the French Revolution in 1798 and he lives on to 1863.</p>

<p>Art should lead to heightened emotion within a bourgeois sphere, middle class sphere.</p>

<h2>ThinkAgain</h2>

<p>Professor name is Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. He going to teach me how to reason and argue. Think more deeply. We going approach reason by <strong>arguments, because arguments are just ways to express reasons.</strong> And if you can understand arguments, you can understand reason.</p>

<p>Good Arguments => Good Reason for the ways which you think and behave.</p>

<p>Understand arguments helps to avoid mistakes.</p>

<ol>
<li>How to analyze arguments (which passages includes arguments)</li>
<li>How to evaluate deductive arguments (propositional and categorical logic)</li>
<li>How to evaluate inductive arguments (generalization, application, inference to the best explanation, causal reasoning, decision making)</li>
<li>How to avoid fallacies (vagueness неопределенность, ambiguity, irrelevance, begging the question)</li>
</ol>


<p>You can&#8217;t win an argument just by <strong>yelling</strong> at someone. That doesn&#8217;t make the argument any better because that&#8217;s not the point of arguing.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t win an argument simply by <strong>calling your opponent a stupid git</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Complainings</strong> just  expressing your emotion about the situation.</p>

<p><strong>An argument</strong> is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition. Sometimes arguments are intended to stablish a propostion, but in other cases they&#8217;re intended to help us understand the proposition and the reasons why the proposition is true.</p>

<p><strong>Argument:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>a series of sentences, statements, or propositions</li>
<li>where some are the premises</li>
<li>and one is the conclusion</li>
<li>where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion.</li>
</ol>
