<p>At what point would it be true that suicide might be rational?</p>

<p>Burn with great deal of pain while their skin regragrafted and the life. And early on in that period, this person said, although he believed that he&#8217;d eventually recover, what he was going to have to go through was so horrible that he wished he were dead.</p>

<h2>Case of Illness</h2>

<p>Since you never know for sure that you won&#8217;t recover, since there&#8217;s always a possibility pf recovery, suicide never makes sense. After all, we all know that there&#8217;s constant progress in medicine, people are always making breakthroughs and what seems like an incurable disease one day may have some sort of cure the next. But <strong>if you killed youself, you&#8217;ve thrown away any chance</strong> of getting that cure. But it seems wrong!</p>

<p><strong>Morality of Suicide</strong>. Theological theory restrict suicide, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Struggle to Intensity</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Every art, every philosophy may be viewed as an aid and remedy in the service of growing and striving life: they always presuppose suffering and sufferers. On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge philosophy how it help to be more alive. Suffering is part of the proccess of invigoration (укрепления).</p>

<p><strong>Ressentiment</strong> - is shows us what you can call a dynamic of reversal. Once upon of time in ancient days there was no moral distinction between good and evel. There was just distinction between good and bad. What makes me feel weak is evel and suddenly the weak person says, all those strong people, those blond beasts, the popular kids, the folks who seem to have it all, those are <strong>evil</strong>. Why? Because they have it all and I don&#8217;t have it. They&#8217;re evel, because they have what it takes to be successfull to dominate others.</p>

<p>The moral distrinction comes from the weak trying to denigrate (порочить) the powerful. <strong>Morality</strong> for Nietzsche is the way the weak protect themselves against strength.</p>

<blockquote><p>To demand that strength does not express itself as strength, that it must not consist of a will to overpower, a will to throw down, a will to rule, a thirst for enemies and opposition and triump - that is as unreasonable as to demand that weakness express itself as strength.</p>

<p>If forgetfulness (забывчивость) were not present, there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no hoping, no pride, no present. The man in whom this repression apparatus is harmed and not working properly we can compare to a dyspeptic ( and not just compare ) - he is &#8216;finished&#8217; with nothing. On the Genealogy of Morals</p></blockquote>

<p>Panishment makes the human animal rememer these values. Suffering goes together with morality, because when we have moral values, we want to see those who violate those values suffer. And suffering, he thinks, is the underbelly of morality.</p>

<blockquote><p>To see others suffer does one good, to make others suffer even more: this is a hard saying, but an acient, mighty, human, all-too-human principle to which even the apes might subscribe&#8230; Without cruelty there is no festival&#8230;</p></blockquote>
