	<h1 class="title">[Modernart] From Struggle to Intensity 1. [Death] Suicide, Part 1. [Humankind] Daily Life in the Stone Age. Part 2</h1>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Intensity replaces morality. Baudelaire and Nietzsche whose work becomes very important for post-modernism much later, they reject the hierarchies that had governed ethics, politics and aesthetics. And in so doing, developed a framework for making poetry and philosophy, respectively. Shoot the clock and let&#8217;s see the world without an expectation that you have to be somewhere else soon.</p>

<p>French revolution 1848. 1853 to 1870 Paris became a new kind of place. New kinds of lighs, which illuminate the boulevard. New kinds of people you see all the time. That becomes the material for Baudelaire poetry.</p>

<p>Two terms to keep in mind - <strong>flaneur</strong> and <strong>dandy</strong>. Dandy - a man unduly devoted to style, neatness, and fashion in dress and appearance. Public presentation of difference, of exaggerated willingness, even desire to be seen. The dandy wants to be seen.</p>

<p>Bohemians are the ones who are living in a garret, living the life on the margins. They&#8217;re not just poor, they&#8217;re living in poverty, because they think poverty is an escape from bourgeois convention. And Baudelaire as a poet vacillates between the dandy and the Bohemian.</p>

<p><strong>Bohemian</strong> - a person, as an artist or writer, who lives and acts free of regard for conventional rules and practices.</p>

<p>They both anti-conventinal.</p>

<p><strong>Flaneurs</strong> - strolls around without purpose, moving through the city streets without going to a particular place. They&#8217;re open to possibility. You don&#8217;t know what youre going to run into. <strong>Most of us living in situations where we constrict the possibility in favor of security or convention.</strong> You see the people you want to see, segregation insures that in many places in this country and abroad, segregation by class, by race, by gender sometimes.</p>

<p>Anythin that you can do to pursue intensity might lead actually to real poetry or real art.</p>

<hr />

<h1>The Rationality of Suicide</h1>

<p>We face the possibility to end our life earlier than it would end otherwise. Two-state requirements not met, because death is not the state. You can make assumption based on before and after, because it is no after at all. But in the same case with two-state requirements we can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s better to be alive then.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Daily life in the stone age</h1>

<p>Lived in small band (at most several hundreds). The dog was the first animal that homosapiens domesticated (15 000 years ago dogs were already part of human bands).</p>

<p>Trade some luxury items, kind of political things about others band, they also celebrated some religious events.</p>

<p>They lived in constant movement, from one place to another place, in search of food. Influenced by animals and birds migration winter and summer time, also follow cycles of growth plants.</p>

<p>Fishing villages might have appeared on the coast of Indonesia around 45 000 years ago.</p>

<p>35-45 hours each week, it was enought to go hunting one day out of three days.</p>

<p>Missunderstanding stats about average life cycle about 35-40, but it&#8217;s because childbirth deaths.</p>

<p>Better nutrition.</p>
