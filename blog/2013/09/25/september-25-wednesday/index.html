	<div class="entry-content"><h2>Art, Loss, and Forgiveness</h2>

<p>Read <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91t/">To the lighthouse</a> by Virginia Woolf.</p>

<p><strong>Virgina Woolf</strong> was part of a group that has stimulated the imagination of historians and literary critics for a long time, the <em>Bloomsbury group</em>. They saw middle class morality as hypoctritical in many cases and they wanted to go beyond that, although they were very much middle class, they go beyond convention in terms of friendship, in terms of sexuality, in terms of art making, to find something that would be more meaningful and less violent and less hypoctritical.</p>

<p>Intrinsic goods like friendship, beauty, art, love stood on their own and commitment to them structured your other beliefs, rather than your other beliefs leading you to have a commitment to friendship or love or beauty.</p>

<p>Moore was an analytic philosopher. But one of the things he tried to show was that no matter how much precision you use, how much <strong>scientifically</strong> organized argument you use, <strong>you could not actually define the good.</strong></p>

<p>Goodness is indefinable, goodness is not reducible to anything else.
Learning to draw, to play the piano, to read a poem didn&#8217;t have to be justified in terms of how much money you would make later on. Because actually no one says that making money is the highest good. And Moor and the the Bloomsbury group said no, no, art is its own thing, it doesn&#8217;t have to be justified in other terms, so too friendship, so too love.</p>

<h2>There is No Justice in History</h2>

<p>Your classify people into several different categories and then treat people according to the category to which they belongs without really bothering to know who they are and what their true abilities and true personality is.</p>

<p>For example, in traditional Hindu society if you are going to marry, say, you&#8217;re looking for a potential bride or groom. The first thing and mose important thing that you want to know about this person, your potential husband or wife is to which caste they belong.</p>

<p>Similarly, today in the world capitalists believe that the reason hierarchy of wealth and this hierarchy of wealth reflects real differences in the ability and qualities of people. Capitalists at least, many of them believe that the rich have more money and privileges because they are more intelligent and hard working and this is how they became rich. So according to the capitilist no one should be bothered if the rich get better health care, better education and nutrition because they have earned it.</p>

<p>Most of the abilities of people have to be nurtured and developed even if somebody is born with a particular talent. Like playing football, or doing business. That talent will usually remain latent if it is not fostered and exircised. And not all people in a particular society get the same chance to cultivate and exercise their abilities. Weather or not they will have an opportunity to do so will usually depend on their place within the imagined hierarchy of that society.</p>

<p>Even if people belonging to different classes somehow develop exactly the same abilities, still they are unlikely to enjoy equal chances of success because they will have to play the game by different rules.</p>

<p>People have been given by a long evolutionary process a fear of polluting themselves by coming in contact with all kinds of things that might cause them diseases, like dead bodies, rotten corpses or bad food. Then, all kinds of religions and social systems &#8220;hijacked&#8221; this biological mechanisms of developing disgust towards something and turned it agains certain groups of people.</p>

<p>Racial system in American was caused by European invasion and conquest of America in the early modern period, and more importantly, the importation by the European conquerors of millions of African slaves to work in the mines and plantations of America.</p>

<p><strong>Why they didn&#8217;t employ simple the local indians</strong> is that the Europeans brought with them a lot of unfamiliar illnesses, diseases, to American and the Indians died in millions. More than 90% of the population of the America, died within a century of the arrival of Europeans. So they had to import people from someplace else to work in mines.</p>

<p><strong>Why they didn&#8217;t employ people from Europe or India or China?</strong> <strong>First</strong> of all, Africa was closer to American than Asia, so it was cheaper to import slaves from Senegal than to import slaves from Vietnam. <strong>Secondly</strong>, in Africa was already existed a very well developed slave trade. Mainly muslim slave traders North Africa and the Middle East developed in the previous centuries a lively trade in African slaves which were exported from Central Africa to North Africa and the Middle East. <strong>Third</strong>, and most important reason, is that American plantations of sugar, cotton, coffee and so forth, were mostly located in tropical areas of America. Like Tahiti and Brazil, Lousiana and Virginia. And these tropical areas were plagued by tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever which had originated in Africa. So, African had immune to this diseases and it was much better for investors buying an African slave who was already resistant to malaria and yellow fever, than buying, say, an Irish slave who would die within six months.</p>

<p>European theologians said that Africans descended from Ham, son of the biblical Noah and Ham was cursed by his father Noah that his offspring would be slaves. And this is why it&#8217;s okay to enslave Africans.</p>

<p>One of the sad truths about history is that over time, unjust discrimination against a particular group of people often gets worse, not better. Money, very often comes to money, and poverty comes to poverty. Most sociopolitical hierarchies in human history, they lack any objective biological and logical basis. They are nothing but a perpetuation of accidental events which are supported by imagined stories that people invented over time.</p>
