	<div class="entry-content"><p>Facing up to the reality of the pleasures we get from suffering from cruelty, actually opens up the horizon for us. Shame, he thinks, is a great inhibitor on intensity.</p>

<blockquote><p>What really arouses indignation (возмущение) against suffering is not suffering as such but the senselessness of suffering&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>When we are violate the moral law we are in debt, we create a debt and we have to pay back and this society becomes our creditor. And so the question becomes for Nietzsche, <strong>how do we burn in the sense that I owe something to society, to my community because I have violated its rules?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Morality is just a cover that the weak use to protect themselves against the strong.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Today it is impossible to say clearly why we really have punishment - all ideas in which an entire process is semiotically summarized elude (ускользать) definition - <strong>only something which has no history is capable of being defined.</strong></p>

<p>All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward - this is what I call the internalization of man: thus it was that man first developed what was later called his &#8216;soul&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>By denying our instincts to act, to be cruel, to break out of our conventions we force them into other cavities, other channels.</p>

<p>Morality becomes a kind of self-torture.</p>

<blockquote><p>He sees in &#8216;God&#8217; the ultimate antithesis of his own ineluctable animal instincts; he reinterprets these very animal instincts as a form of guilt against God: this thought becomes a form of torture to him.</p>

<p>But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? &#8230; We modern men are the heirs of the conscience-vivisection and self-torture of millenia&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nietzche want to liberate us from our morality and from our pursuit of foundations. He want to have us realize that the things we&#8217;re taught that are most precious are actually symptoms of our fear of our own strength.</p>

<h1>The Human Flood</h1>

<p>How sapiens related to other animals and plants. The first breakout from the inner world of Afro-Asia to the outer occurred about 45 000 years ago in Australia. How could sapiense from Asia reach Australia about 45 000 years ago? (we found bones and sapiens tools there). They learned how to build an maneuver ocean going vessels and became fishermen, long distance explorer and traders.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Morality of Suicide and Course Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Morality is always about how I treat others, it&#8217;s not about how I treat myself. And if we accept that claim we can say that the right to life only covers how I treat others.</p>

<p>When I kill myself I&#8217;m doing it for my own sake. That seems highly relevant in thinking about the morality of suicide. You might think that the relevance of saying that I&#8217;m harming mysqlf for my own sake is this. If I&#8217;m harming myself for my own sake, what I&#8217;m saying is, despite the fact that I&#8217;m harming mysqlf, I&#8217;m better off.
When I kill myself, given that I&#8217;m doing it for my own benefit, I&#8217;ve obviously got my own agreement. I can&#8217;t kill myself agains my will. That seems pretty important. Consent can make it acceptable to do to someone what would normally be wrong in the absence of their consent.</p>

<p>Boxing is moraly acceptable. But I can&#8217;t hit someone without concent. Consent makes it legitimate to harm people.</p>

<p>Suicide isn&#8217;t always legitimate, but it&#8217;s sometimes legitimate.</p>

<p>Face death without fear and without illusion.</p>
