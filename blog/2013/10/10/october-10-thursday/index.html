<p>When people think they&#8217;re pursuing sexual freedom, they create new categories for how you should pursue sexual freedom. New forms of identity to which you should conform even if that identity is liberatory, is outside of the main stream. But you create a new mode of being that you then have to conform to. This is Foucault&#8217;s great subject. <strong>How we, in a way, police ourselves.</strong> How we dominate ourselves by saying, oh, I am going to be a radical. And now, I have to act like the radicals act.</p>

<p>In other words, you conform to the image of radicalization. Some might you say, well, I am not a diseased person because I like to have sex with people of my own gender. No, no, I am not that, I am free, I am gay, or I&#8217;m a homosexual or I&#8217;m a lesbian. I am free. And <strong>Foucault</strong> says, yeah, you&#8217;re free, but now notice how we start to have to conform to being gay, being lesbian.</p>

<p>Why do we need always to find a new mode of conformity? A label for our freedom that comes then to repress us.</p>

<blockquote><p>Modern man, for Baudelaire, is not the man who goes off to discover himself, his secrets and his hidden truth; he is the man who tries to invent himself. This modernity does not &#8220;liberate man in his own being&#8221;; it compels him to face the task of producing himself.</p></blockquote>
