<p>Even while we celebrate individualism, we have this tendency to create a situation where individualism results in everybody trying to be an individual in the same way. It creates even more conditions for conformity. <em>Emerson is the enemy of conformity, he is the enemy of imitation.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Insist on yourself; never imitate.</p></blockquote>

<p>Finding yourself throught action rather than thought a process that aims to discover a foundation or some goal for you entire life. <strong>You are free to recreate every day.</strong> In fact by recreating yourself every day you have this opennes to experience of that can be extraordinarily powerful and conform to no onse else at all.</p>

<h2>Ludwig Wittgenstein</h2>

<p>How language really works when someone&#8217;s asking for objects in a contruction project and also how we learn languages, how to understand the ways in which our words get meaning.</p>

<blockquote><p>From its seeming to me - or to everyone - to be so, it doesn&#8217;t follow that it is so. What we can ask is whether it can make sense to doubt it. Ludwig Wittgenstein</p></blockquote>

<h2>[humankind] The Direction of History</h2>

<p>People do their work or exchange their goods to money when they trust the figments of the collective imagination. <strong>Trust</strong> is the real raw material from which all types of money in history have been minted.</p>

<p>Money is the most universal and most effictien system of mutual trust ever devised by human beings. How to create trust in money?</p>

<p>The first coins in history, as far as we know, were struck around 640 BC by Kind Elliotus of the kingdom of Lydia (western Turkey).</p>

<p>Religion wants us to believe in something like in God, money doesn&#8217;t ask us to believe in anything in particular. Money simply asks us to believe that other people believe in something.</p>

<p>Universal principles of money:</p>

<ul>
<li>Universal convertivility</li>
<li>Universal trust</li>
</ul>
