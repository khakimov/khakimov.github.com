<p>A religion that recognizes the legitimacy of other faith, implies either that its god is not the supreme power of the universe or that it reveived from the one and only god, only part of the universal truth. &#8220;If our religion is true no other religion can also simultaneously be true.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dualistic religions</strong> - are religions that believe in the existence not of one supreme Good but of two opposing powers, good and evil. Dualism believes that evil is an independent power, which is not created by the good god and is not subordinate to it.</p>

<p>Wars, plague, death, suffer - this is God&#8217;s way of allowing for human free will. If there was no evil in the world, humans could not choose between good and evel; and hence, there would be no free will.</p>
