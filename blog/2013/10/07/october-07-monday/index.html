<p>Horkheimer and Adorno writing in the Nazi period what problem are they trying to address? What issue are they trying to explain?</p>

<p>They are trying to understand the attractions of fascism and Nazism, why the working classes don&#8217;t rebel against their owners of capital, why they don&#8217;t rebel against the massive corporations or the political parties that feed them.</p>

<p>They saw this really nefarious (гнусный, бесчестный) globalization as a product of enlightenment. They asw modernity and enlughtenment joining hands to create a new universal myth that entrapped us with its appeal while controlling us and diminising our freedom at every step.</p>

<blockquote><p>Englightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth is radiant with triumphant calamity. Enlightenment&#8217;s program was the disenchantment of the world. Horkheimer and Adorno</p>

<p>Techonology is the essence of this knowlegde. It aims to produce neither concepts nor images, nor the joy of understanding, but method, exploitation of the labor of others&#8230; What human beings seek to learn from nature is how to use it to dominate wholly both it and human beings. Nothing else counts.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Imperial Visions</h2>

<p>What empire is? It is a political order which has two very important characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>rules over a significant number of distinct peoples, each possessing a different cultural identity and a separate territory.</p></li>
<li><p>It has flexible borders and a potentially unlimited appetite.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s very common today to hear that in the long run, it is not possible to rule effectively over a large number of conquered people, that empires are doomed to failure and to collapse. The second main objection to empires is not only that they don&#8217;t work, but also that they are evil.</p>

<p>Empire has been the world&#8217;s most common form of political organization for the last 2500 years. Emires are a very stable, irrelatively, when compared to other form of goverments, empire is very stable form of government.</p>

<p>Most empires have been collapsed either because of external invasion of external enemies or because of a split within the ruling elite itself.</p>

<p>The standard imperial toolkit with which you build and maintain an empire includes war, enslavement, deportation and genocide.</p>
