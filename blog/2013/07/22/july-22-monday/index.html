<h1>Defining Obesity</h1>

<ul>
<li>82% increase in global obesity X 20 years</li>
<li>middle east 100% increase since 1990</li>
<li>2008: > 1.4 billion adults, age 20+ overweight</li>
<li>200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese</li>
<li>65% global population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweigth</li>
<li>more than 40 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2010</li>
</ul>


<p>Louis Dublin:</p>

<ul>
<li>small, medium, large</li>
<li>20-25% > desirable wt for frame</li>
<li>70-100% > desirable wt for frame</li>
</ul>


<p>Adolphe Quetelet create quetelet index (1832), weight increases as the square of the height</p>

<p>Dr. Ancel Keys confirmed validity of Quetelet index and coined the term &#8220;BMI&#8221; in 1972.</p>

<p>BMI - kg/m2 or (lb/in2) * 703:</p>

<ul>
<li>underweight &lt; 18.5</li>
<li>normal weight 18.5 - 24.9</li>
<li>overweight 25.0 - 29.9</li>
<li>obese > 30</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additional Measurements:</h2>

<ul>
<li>waist circumference</li>
<li>waist-to-hip ratio</li>
<li>skinfold thickness</li>
<li>percent body fat (bioelectrical impedance, underwater weighung, DEXA)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Causes of Obesity</h2>

<ul>
<li>increased intake of energy-dense food that are high in fat, salt and sugar but low in vitamins and minerals</li>
<li>decrease in physical activity</li>
</ul>


<h1>2. Energy Balance</h1>

<p><em>Intake</em> (calories from food) and <em>Output</em> (calories used to maintain body function and physical activity)</p>

<p>Intake:</p>

<ul>
<li>protein</li>
<li>fat</li>
<li>carbohydrates</li>
<li>alcohol</li>
</ul>


<p>Output:</p>

<ul>
<li>basal metabolism (burning just sitting)</li>
<li>thermic effect of food (burning to process)</li>
<li>physical activity (15-30% of total energy expenditure, walking, yard work)</li>
<li>thermogenesis (sleeping, eating, sports-like exercise)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Storage of Excess Calories:</h2>

<ul>
<li>excess carbohydrate stores as fat</li>
<li>excess protein stores as fat</li>
<li>excess fat stores as fat (converted and stores as fat)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Metabolic fitness</h2>

<ul>
<li>central obesity</li>
<li>triglyceride levels</li>
<li>HDL</li>
<li>blood pressure</li>
<li>fasting blood glucose</li>
</ul>


<h1>3. Metabolic syndrome</h1>

<p>Claster of risk factors. Heart deasis, stroke, diabet.</p>

<p>Criteria for Metabolic Syndrome(at least 3 of those 5):</p>

<ul>
<li>waist circumference (males > 40 inches, females 35 inches)</li>
<li>high blood pressure > 130/85 mm Hg</li>
<li>fasting blood sugar > 110 mm Hg</li>
<li>triglycerides > 150 mm Hg</li>
<li>HDL males &lt; 40 mg/dL, females &lt; 50 mg/dL</li>
</ul>


<p>Apple-shaped fat patterning (more dangerious) and Pear-shaped fat patterning.</p>

<p>Metabolic syndrome doubled the risk of heart attack in both men and women.</p>

<h1>4. Pediatric Obesity</h1>

<p>1:6 US children obese; 1:3 are overweigh or obese</p>

<p>6-11 year old:</p>

<ul>
<li>1980 7%</li>
<li>2008 20% (tripled)</li>
</ul>


<p>12-19 year old:</p>

<ul>
<li>1980 5%</li>
<li>2008 18%</li>
</ul>


<p>43 millions preschool in 2010 (35 million of these are in development country). As countries wealth increases traditional diet towards a more westernized diet.</p>

<ul>
<li>increase diabetes 2</li>
<li>cardiovascular</li>
<li>bone and joing</li>
<li>to be obese adults</li>
<li>cancer</li>
</ul>


<h2>Prevention</h2>

<ul>
<li>school based nutriotion</li>
<li>wellness programs in communities</li>
<li>nutrition assistance programs</li>
<li>food marketing to children</li>
<li>screen time</li>
<li>save neighborhoods and built enviroment</li>
<li>access to sugar-sweetened beverages</li>
</ul>


<p>Signal called leptin. Leptin is a hormone that&#8217;s made from your fat cells, goes to your brain, and tell you, you&#8217;ve had enough. But insulin blocks that signal.</p>

<h1>Justice </h1>

<p>Kant says that laws arise from a vertain kind of social contract. But this contract is of an exceptional nature. He points out that <em>the contract that generates justice</em> is what he calls an <em>idea of reason</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A contract that generates principles of right is merely an idea of reason, but it has undoubted practical reality, because it can oblige (обязывать) every legislator to frame his laws in such a way that they could have been produced by the united will of the whole nation. Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>What is the moral force of a hypthetical contract, a contract that never happened?</strong></p>

<p>John Rawls who worked out in his book a detail an acouunt of a hypothetical agreement as the basis for justice. Like Kant, Rawls was a critic of utilitarianism:</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote><p>Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override&#8230; The rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining (переговоры) or to the calculus of social interests. John Rawls</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Principles of justice, properly undersood, can be derived from hypothetical social contract, not an actual one. (Veil (вуаль) of ignorance).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The way to arrive at the basic right that we must respect, the basic framework of rights and duties is to imagine that we were gathered together trying to choose the principles to govern our collective lives without knowing cerain important particular facts about ourselves. - <strong>That&#8217;s the idea of veil of ignorance</strong></p>

<p>Veil of ignorance abstracts us from or brackets, hides from us, who in particular we are, our race, class, place in society, we&#8217;re healthy or unhealthy. Then we would agree to we come up to principles of justice. <strong>That&#8217;s how the hypothetical contract works</strong></p>

<p>What is the moral force of this kind of hypothetical agreement? Is it stronger or weaker than actual social contract?</p>

<h1>Moral force of actual contracts:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>how do they bind or obligate me?</p></li>
<li><p>consent-based as a voluntary act and it points to the ideal of <strong>autonomy</strong>. <em>When I make a contract, the obligation is one that is self-imposed and that carries a certain moral weight independent of other considerations</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>benefit-based and this points toward the ideal of <strong>reciprocity</strong> (взаимность). <em>I can have an obligation to you insofar as you do something for me</em></p></li>
<li><p>how do actual real life contracts justife the terms they produce? they dont! at least not on their own. the fact of the agreement never garuantees the fairness of the agreement. (Constitution about persisting slaver - it was an actual contract, but that doesn&#8217;t establish that the laws agreed to, all of them, were just)</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Example</h1>

<p>We made an agreement, a commercial agreement. I promise to pay you 100$ if you will go harvest and bring to me 100 lobsters. You go our and bring them to me, I eat the lobsters, serve them to my friends and then I don&#8217;t pay. And you say, but you&#8217;re obligated! I say - why? Well, we had a deal and you benefited, you ate all those lobsters. I benefited from your labor - very strong argument.</p>

<p>Second case, then we made the agreement and in two minutes I called and say I&#8217;ve changed my mind. No benifits, no lobsters, no work you part, there is no element of reciprocal exchange. Do I still owe you?</p>

<p>paternalism (отеческое попечение)</p>

<p>A contract or an act of consent is not only not sufficient, but it&#8217;s not even a necessary condition of there being an obligation.</p>

<p><strong>David Hume</strong></p>

<p>When he was young, Hume wrote a book arguing against Locke&#8217;s idea of an original social contract. He said, &#8220;It was a philosophical fiction, one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible (непонятный) operations that can possibly be imagined&#8221;. And then when he was 62 he got an example of it:</p>

<p>house -> his friend rented it -> sub-lent it to third person and this person signed a contract with painter to paint the house and send the bill to Hume (he refused to pay). In court he said he didn&#8217;t sign any contract, that was true. Defance failed and he had to pay.</p>

<p><strong>The main idea - actual contracts have their moral force in virtue of two distinguishable ideals, autonomy and reciprocity</strong> <em>But in real life, every actual contract may fall short, may fail to realize the ideal that give contracts their moral force in the first place.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Justice Lecture 15</p>

<p>How should income and wealth and power and opportunities be distributed?</p>

<p>Why Rawls think that principles of justice are best derived from a hyphotetical contract? <em>Hyphotetical contract be carried out in an original position of equality (the veil of ignorance)</em></p>

<p>Principles choosen behind the veil of ignorance.
Fundamental right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly (свобода собраний), religious:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Utilitarism makes a mistake because forgetting it&#8217;s not taking seriosly the distinction between persons. We wouldn&#8217;t trade off our fundamental right and liberties for any economic advantages.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#8217;s require an equal deistribution income and wealth, but we could do better if we agree to qualified principle of equality (Rawls calls it the difference principle). A principle that says only those social and economic inequalities will be permited that work to the benefit of the least well off (в интересах наименее обеспеченных). Test would be <strong>do they work to the benefit of everyone, including those, especially those at the bottom.</strong></p></li>
</ol>


<p>The distribution of income and wealth and opportunities should not be based on factors for which people can clainm no credit, it shouldn&#8217;t be based on factors that are arbitrary from a moral point of view.</p>

<p><strong>Feudal aristocracy</strong>. What&#8217;s wrong? Rawls says, the thing that&#8217;s obviosly wrong about it is that people&#8217;s life prospects are determined by the accident of birth, you can&#8217;t rise, it&#8217;s not your doing where you wind up or what opportunities you have.</p>

<p><strong>Libertarian system</strong>. What&#8217;s wrong? Rawls says, it&#8217;s an improment because it doesn&#8217;t take as fixed the accident of birth. And even so, if you let everybody run the race, everybody can enter the race, but some people start at different starting points, that race isn&#8217;t going to be fair.</p>

<p>Merit based system, a <strong>meritrocratic system</strong>. Everyone regardless of their family background, has a genuinely fair opportunity. Everyone starts from the same starting line. Rawls thinks even that, doesn&#8217;t go far enough in remedying (устранение) or addressing the moral arbitrariness of the natural lottery. Because if your bring everyone at the same starting point and begin the race, who&#8217;s going to win the race? The fastest runner would win, but is it their doing that they happen to be blessed with the athletic prowess to run fast? So, even the principle of <strong>meritocracy</strong>, where you bring everyone to the same starting point, may eliminate the influence of social contingencies and upbringing, <em>but it still permits the distribution of wealth and icome to be determined by the natural distribution of abilities and talents</em>.</p>

<p>People may benefit from their good fortune, from their luck in the genetic lottery, but only on terms that work to the advantage of the least well off.</p>

<p>Example: Michael Jordan can make $31 million, but only under a system that taxes away a chunk of that to help those who lack the basketball skills that he&#8217;s blessed with.</p>

<p>Bill Gates, but he can&#8217;t think he somehow morally deserves those billions.</p>

<blockquote><p>Those who have been favored by nature, whoever they are, may gain from their good fortune only on terms that improve the situation of those who have lost our. John Rawls</p></blockquote>
