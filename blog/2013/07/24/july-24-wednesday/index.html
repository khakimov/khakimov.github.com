<p>Suppose there are two candidates who did equally well on the tests and grades, both of whom went to first-rate schools. Among those candidates, would it be unfair for the college or univesity to say we still want diversity along racial and ethnic dimensions, even where we are not correcting for the effects on test scores of educational disadvantage.</p>

<p><em>Legacy admissions</em> is giving an advantage to someone who has an arbitraty privilege of their parent having attended the univesrity to which they&#8217;re applying.</p>

<h1>Arguments for Affirmative Action:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>One argument has to do with correcting for the effects of educational disadvantage. <strong>Corrective</strong> - <em>correcting for differences in educational backgrounds.</em> That argument is consistent in principle with the idea that only academic promise and scholarly potential should count in admissions. We just need to go beyond test scores and grades alone to get a true estimate of academic promise and scholarly ability.</p></li>
<li><p>Affirmative action is justified even where there may not be the need to correct for educational disadvantage in a particular applicant&#8217;s case. <strong>Compensatory</strong> - <em>compensating for past wrongs.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversity</strong> - (different from compensatory, because it makes a certain appeal to the social purpose or the social mission of the college or univesity) Two arguments:</p></li>
<li><p><em>for educational experience for everyone</em></p></li>
<li><em>for society as whole</em> (we need to train lawyers, and judges, and leaders, public officials who will contribute to the strength, the civic strength of the state of Texas and the country as whole)</li>
</ol>


<p>When reviewing the large number of candidates able to do well in our classes race may count as a plus, just as coming from Iowa may count or being a good middle linebacker or pianist.</p>

<p>A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something a white student cannot offer. The quality of the educational experience of all students depends in part on these differences in the background and outlook that students bring with them.</p>

<h1>Mobile Malware</h1>

<h2>Two layers:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dalvic VM (sms send/recv)</li>
<li>OS interaction (read/write files)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Static:</h1>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>many info in the Manifest</li>
<li>java is relatively easy to decompile</li>
<li>potentially sees the whole behavior</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>obfuscation and optimizations</li>
<li>reflection</li>
<li>dynamic code, native code</li>
</ul>


<h1>Dynamic:</h1>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>resilient to obfuscation</li>
<li>potentially transparent (VMM)</li>
<li>less comples than static</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>code coverage</li>
<li>VMI can be cumbersome (громоздкий) (VMM)</li>
<li>instrumental can be detected</li>
</ul>


<h1>CopperDroid</h1>

<p>Unified dynamic analysis technique to characterize the behavior of android malware.</p>

<ol>
<li>automatically reconstruct the behaviors</li>
<li>system call centric analysis</li>
<li>android version independent</li>
<li>dynamically stimulates apps to disclose additional behaviors</li>
</ol>


<h1>System calls on Linux ARM</h1>

<p>Like on Intel, on ARM architecture invoking a system call induces a user-to-kernel transiction.</p>

<ul>
<li>On ARM invoked through the <em>swi</em> instruction</li>
<li><em>r7</em> contains the number of the invoked syscall</li>
<li><em>r0-r5</em> contain parameters</li>
<li><em>lr</em> contains the return address</li>
</ul>


<p>System call analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>intercept when a syscall is invoked</li>
<li>we need to intercept return to user-space too!</li>
<li>there is no SYSEXIT/SYSRET to intercept</li>
<li>not every syscall actually returns to <em>lr</em> (exit, execve)</li>
</ul>


<p>CopperDriod&#8217;s Approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>instruments QEMU&#8217;s emulation of the swi instruction</li>
<li>instruments QEMU to intercept every cpsr_write (Kernel -> User)</li>
</ul>


<p>CopperDroid VMI:</p>

<ul>
<li>process name</li>
<li>pid and tid</li>
<li>process resources</li>
</ul>


<p>when executing kernel code, the <em>base</em> of the stack points to the current executing thread.</p>

<p>Binder protocol is the core of Android IPC/RPC</p>

<ul>
<li>intents are carried through binder</li>
<li>interactions with the system go through binder</li>
<li>binder driver enforces (some) permission policies</li>
</ul>


<p>Application cannot send SMSs on their own, but must invoke (RPC) the proper system service to do that.</p>

<p>Android malware needs to be properly stimulated to trigger more malicious behaviors and increase coverage of dynamic analysis.</p>

<p>CopperDroid Ad-Hoc Stimuli</p>

<ol>
<li>Identifies events the target reacts to (mostly contained in the Manifest file)</li>
<li>During the analysis, injects customs evenets (of those identified as useful)</li>
</ol>


<p>MonkeyRunner to inject events.</p>

<p>CopperDroid - automatically reconstruct the behaviors of android malware.</p>

<h1>Plato with arguments for the immortality of the Soul</h1>

<p>Suppose I pluck a string on my harp, producing a certain note. As we know, the vibrations of one string can set into play the other strings vibrating as well. That would be analogous to what goes on when my mind affects my body.</p>

<p><strong>An essential property</strong> is a property that a given object must have; it always has as long as it exists at all.</p>

<p><strong>A contingent property</strong> is a property that an object may have, may happen to have its entire existence, but could&#8217;ve existed without.</p>

<p>My car is blue (contingent property), it could be red, but the car will still exist. It could exist as a red car and even if I don&#8217;t change the color, still it could be red.</p>

<p>Pencil is whole, but I could break it (contingent property).</p>

<p><strong>Fire</strong> and being hot, fire is hot, that&#8217;s property, it isn&#8217;t contingent property, it IS <em>essential property</em>!</p>

<p>Plato says &#8221;<strong>Here is an essential property for the soul. Wherever there&#8217;s a soul it&#8217;s alive (it&#8217;s thinking, something capable of thought).</strong>&#8221;</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Life is an essential property of the soul.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soul is deathless.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>_Anything that&#8217;s deathless - cannot die, indestructible.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soul cannot be destroyed.</strong></p></li>
</ol>


<p>What does it mean to say that something is <strong>deathless</strong>?</p>

<ul>
<li>it can&#8217;t be that <strong>soul exists AND dead</strong></li>
<li>it can&#8217;t be that <strong>soul was destroyed</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>If life is an essential property of the soul, then that means we will never have soul in our hand and is dead.</p>

<p>How do you go about proving what something doesn&#8217;t exist? When do you need to prove that something doesn&#8217;t exist?
Example with dragons, how do I prove that there aren&#8217;t any dragons? Debunk about dragons and unicorns, you don&#8217;t need to check all caves around the world to say &#8220;no dragons here, no dragons in there&#8221;, <em>you are pretty much justified in being skeptical about the existence of dragons once you&#8217;ve undermined the arguments for dragons.</em></p>

<h1>Justice, Lecture 18. Aristotle: Justice and virtue</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>race and ethnice should count as a way of correcting for the true meaning of test scores and grades.</p></li>
<li><p>compensatory arguments, the idea of righting past wrongs, past injustice.</p></li>
<li><p>diversity argument. social mission, the common good (texas law school example).</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Can the university define its social purpose any way it wants to and then define admissions criteria accordingly?</strong></p>

<p>Justice is not a matter of rewarding or honoring virtue or honoring moral desert. Somehow they think tying justice to moral merit or virtue is going to lead away from freedom, from respect for persons as free beings.</p>

<p><strong>Aristotle</strong> explicitly ties justice to honor, honoring virtue and merit and moral desert.</p>

<p>For <strong>Aristotle, justice is</strong> a matter of giving people what they deserve, giving people their due. It&#8217;s a matter of figuring our the proper fir between persons with their virtues and their appropriate social roles.</p>

<p>Justice means giving each person his or her due, giving people what they deserve. <strong>But what is a person&#8217;s due?</strong>
Aristotle says that depends on the sort of things being distributed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Justice involves two factors: <strong>things</strong> and the <strong>persons</strong> to whom the things are assigned. In general we say that persons who are equal should have equal things assigned to them. Aristotle</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Equals in what respect?</strong> That depends on the sort of thing we are distributing. Example with <strong>flutes</strong> and it&#8217;s distributing. What is the relevant merit or basis of desert for flutes? Who should get the best ones? Artistotle answers was - the best flute players. All justice involves districimination, he says, what matters is that the distrimination be according to the relevant excellence, according to the virtue appropriate to having flutes. He says, it would be unjust to discriminte on some other basis in giving our the flutes.</p>

<p><strong>Why should best fluet goes to the best fluet player?</strong> Because that&#8217;s fluets are for, to be played well.</p>

<p><strong>TELOS - the point, the end, the goal</strong></p>

<p><strong>TELEOLOGICAL REASONING - Reasoning from the &#8220;telos&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><em>Reasoning from the purpose or from the telos or from the end.</em> Aristotle says that&#8217;s indispensable to thinking about justice.</p>

<p>sovereign - суверенный, независимый
essential - существенный, основной, неотъемлемость
contingent - контингент, случай, условный, случайны
burden - бремя, нагрузка, груз
virtue - добродетель, сила, достоинство
indispensable - незаменимый, необходимый</p>
