<p><strong>John Locke. Of the state of Nature.</strong></p>

<p>All men has a state of perfect freedom to order their actions within the bounds of the law of nature. A state also of equality, no one having more than another, creatures of the same cpecies and rank, have same advantages of nature, and the use of the same faculties.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 6</strong> Nothing may authroze us to destroy one another.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 7</strong> Any may do in prosecution of equality, every one must have a right to do. All men may be restrained from doing hurt to one another.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 8</strong> the only reasons, why one man may lawfully do harm to another, which is that we call punishment. Every man has a right to punish the offender and be executioner of the law of nature.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 11</strong> every man, in the state of nature, has a power to kill a murderer.</p>

<p><strong>Of the state of War</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 16</strong> Men should have a right to destroy that which threatens him with destruction. Preserver as much as possible, when all cannot be preserved, the safety of the innocent is to be preferred: and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 17</strong> freedom being the foundation of everything else and if somebody would take it away - state of war.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 18</strong> this makes it lawful for a man to kill a thief that has no right to get a man in his power, he has no reason to suppoer, that thief, who would take away libery, would not take away everything else.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 20</strong> the state of war once begun, continues, with a right to the innocent party to destroy the other whenever he can, until the aggressor offers peace.</p>

<p><strong>Of Slavery</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 22</strong> natural liberty of man - to be free from any superior power on earth and not be under the will or legislative authority of man. Liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 23</strong> no body can give more power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 24</strong> drudgery isn&#8217;t slavery, because master coud not have power to kill and men was obliged to let go free out of his service.</p>

<p><strong>Of Property</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 25</strong> Men have a right to their preservation, but how any one should ever come to have a property in any thing.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 26</strong> The earth is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. The fruit or venison (оленина), which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 27</strong> The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 28</strong> Thus the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place, where I have a right to them in common with others, become my property, without the assignation or consent of any body. The labour that was mine, removing them out of that common state they were in, hath fixed my property in them.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 29</strong> Men labor has taken it out of the hands of nature belonged equally to all her children, and hath thereby appropriated it to himself.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 32</strong> As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property.</p>

<p>If someone violates the law of nature:
- he&#8217;s aggressor
- he&#8217;s beyond reason
and you can punish him (kill him as self-defence). It&#8217;s fierce and filled with violence and that is why people want to leave it with consent. The only way to escape the state of nature is undertake an active consent where you agree to give up the enforcement power and to create a goverment where it&#8217;ll be a legislation and everyone who enters to abide whatever the majority decide.</p>

<p><em>The supreme power cannot take from any man any part fo his property without his own consent.</em></p>

<p><em>Men therefore in society having property, they have such a right to the goods, which by the law <strong>of the community</strong> are theirs&#8230;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8230;Goverments cannot be supported without great charge, and it is fit every one who enjoys his share of the protection, should pay out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it. <strong>BUT</strong> still it mush be with his own consent, ie the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves or their representatives chosen by them.</em></p>
