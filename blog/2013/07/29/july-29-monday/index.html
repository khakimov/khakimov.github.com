<p>All about Justice!</p>

<hr />

<p>Objections to the idea that there are obligations of solidarity or membership.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If obligations flow from community membership and identity, we inhabit multiple communities. Doesn&#8217;t that mean that our obligations will sometimes conflict?</p></li>
<li><p>These examples meant to bring out the moral force of solidarity and membership, examples about parents and children, about the French resistance fighter asked to bomb his own village and drawing back, about the airlift Ephiopian Jews - it&#8217;s point to matters of emotions, sentiment, not true moral obligations.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Julia Rotow said that liberalism can endorse patriotism as a voluntary moral obligation. Patriotism and familial love both fall under this category, because after all, the Kantian framework allows people free reign to choose to express virtues such as these if they want to.</p>

<p>Rawls says, when he&#8217;s discussing political obligation, it&#8217;s one thing <strong>if someone runs for office or enlists in the military, they&#8217;re making a voluntary choice. But there is, I believe, no political obligation, strictly speaking, for citizens generally because it&#8217;s not clear what is the requisite bingind action and who has perfomed it.</strong> Rawls acknowledges that for ordinary citizens, there is no political obligation except insofar as some particular citizen willingly (охотно), through an act of consent undertakes or chooses such an obligation.</p>

<p>We can choose, if we want to, to express a loyalty to our country or to our people or to our family, provided we don&#8217;t do any injustice within the framework of universal duties.</p>

<p><strong>Obligations of membership really are kind of collective selfishness. Why should we honor them? Isn&#8217;t it just a kind of prejudice?</strong></p>

<p>Example of loyalty that can and should compete with universal moral claims, respect for persons?</p>

<h2>Dan&#8217;s dillema of loyalty</h2>

<p>Billy Bulger has a brother Whitey Bulger, his brother was in most wanted list, resposible for many murders and now a fugitive from justice. US Attorney called to Billy Bulger to get information about his brother and his refused to give it. You feel more loyalty to your brother than to the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?</p>

<blockquote><p>I never thought of it that way, but I do have a loyalty to my brother. I care about him. I hipe that I&#8217;m never helpful to anyone against him. I don&#8217;t have an obligation to help anyone catch my brother&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Example with Robert E. Lee</h2>

<p>was an officer of Union Army. When war loomed, Lincoln offered Lee to be the commanding general of the Union Army and Lee refused. Why?</p>

<blockquote><p>With all my devition to the Union&#8230; I have not been able to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relatives, my children, my home. If the Union is dissolved I shall return to my native state and share miseries of my people. Save in her defense, I will draw my sword no more. Robert E. Lee</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the worries underlying these multiple objections to the idea of loyalty or membership as having independent moral weight is that it seem to argue that there is no way of finding principles of justice that are detached from conceptions of the good life as they may be lived in any particular community.</p>

<p><em>Suppose</em> the communitarian idea right over the good can&#8217;t be sustained.</p>

<p><em>Suppose</em> instead that justice and right unavoidably are bound up with conceptions of the good. Does that mean that justice is simply a creature of convention, of the values that happened to prevail in any given community at any given time?</p>

<blockquote><p>Justice is relative to social meanings. A given society is just if its substantive (основное, самостоятельный, независимый) life is lived in a certain way, <strong>in a way that is faithful (верный, верующий) to the shared understandings of the members</strong>. Michael Walzer</p></blockquote>

<p>Eyes on the Prize</p>

<hr />

<h1>Lecture 23. Same-Sex marriage</h1>

<p>I would like to defend the narrative conception of the person as against the voluntarist conception. I would like to defend the ideat that there are obligations of solidatiry or membership.</p>

<p>If our encompassing loyalty should always take precedence over more particular one, then the distinction between friends and strangers should ideally be overcome. <em>Our special concern for the welfare of friends would be a kind of prejudice, a measure of our distance from universal human concern</em>. But if you look closely at that idea, what kind of a moral universe, what kind of moral imagination would that lead you to?</p>

<blockquote><p>A tryly virtuous man would come to the aid of the most distant stranger as quickly as to his own friend. <strong>If men were perfectly virtuous, they wouldn&#8217;t have friends.</strong> Montesquieu</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the time, we live our lives by smaller solidarities. We leran to love humanity, not in general, but through its particular expressions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to distinguish <strong>two different ways in which justce can be tied to the good:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>relativist way</strong> - that&#8217;s the way that says, to think about rights, to think about justice, look to the values that happened to prevail in any given community, at any given time. Don&#8217;t judge them by some outside standart, but instead conceive justice as a matter of being faithful to the shared understandings of a particular tradition. But there&#8217;s a problem with this way of tying justice to the good. The problem is that <strong>it makes justice wholly conventional, a product of circumstance.</strong> And this <strong>deprives (лишает)</strong> justice of its critical character.</p></li>
<li><p>non-relativist way of linking justice with conceptions of the good, principles of justice depend for their justification, not on the values that happen to prevail at any given moment, in a certain place, but instead on the moral worth or the instrinsic good of the ends right serve. It&#8217;s not communitarian, ib by communitarian you mean just giving over to a particular community the definition of justice.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>first is insufficient</strong>, because the first leaves justice the creature of convention. <em>It doesn&#8217;t give us enough moral resources to respond to those Southern segregationist</em> who invoke their way of life, their traditions, their way of doing things.</p>

<p>But if justice is bound up with the good in non-relativist way, there&#8217;s a big challenge, a big question to answer. How can we reason about the good? What about the fact that people hold different conceptions of the good, different ideas about the purposes of key social institutions, different ideas about what social goods and human goods are worthy of honor and recognition? <strong>We leave in the prulorist society. People disagree about the good. That&#8217;s one of the incentives (стимулы) to try to find principles of justice and rights that don&#8217;t depend on any particular ends or purposes or goods.</strong></p>

<p>Is it necessary, is it unavoidable, when arguing about justice, to argue about the good? It&#8217;s unavoidable, it&#8217;s necessary.</p>

<h1>Same sex marriage</h1>

<p>Controversial ideas, morally and religiously. Hotly contested moral and religious questions about the moral permissibility of homosexuality, about the proper ends of marriage as a social institution.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Lecture 24: Justice and the good Life</h1>

<p>Is it necessary, is it unavoidable to take up questions of the good life in thinking about justice?</p>

<p>Is it possuble to reason about justice?</p>

<blockquote><p>Many hold equally strong religious, moral, and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled to be married, that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us. Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</p>

<p>What is at stake is respect for individual autonomy and equality under law. At stake is an individual freely choosing the person with whom to share an exclusive commitment.</p></blockquote>

<p>If government really must be neutral then the consistent position is what we have been describing as abolition (упразднение) of marriage at least as a state function. Dis-establishment of religion</p>

<p>The reason for the opposition to same sex marriage is that it would go beyond neutral toleration and give same sex marriage a government stamp of approval.</p>

<p>Same sex marriage can&#8217;t be justified on the basis of liberal neutrality or nondiscrimination or autonomy rights alone. Because the question at stake in the public debate is whether same sex unions have moral worth, whether they&#8217;re worthy of honor and recognition, and whether they fit the purpose of the social institution of marriage.</p>

<blockquote><p>Let churches and other religious institutions offer marriage ceremonies. Let depertment stores and cainos get into the act if they want to. Let couples celebrate their union in any way they choose and consider themselves married whenever they want. Michael Kinsley</p>

<p>And if three people want to get married, or if one person wants to marry himself or herself, and someone else wants to conduct a ceremony for them and declare them married, let them. If you and your government aren&#8217;t implicated (вовлечено), what do you care?</p>

<p>In a real sense there are three partners to every civil marriage: two willing spouses and an approving State. Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment, and also a highly public celebration of the ideals of mitiality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. Supreme Court</p></blockquote>

<h1>Telos of marriage</h1>

<blockquote><p>Not procreation, but the exclusive and permanent commitment of the partners to one another is the essential point and purpose of marriage. Supreme Court</p></blockquote>

<p>If reasoning about the good is unavoidable in debates about justice and rights, is it possible? If reasoning about the good means that <strong>you must have a single principle or rule, or maxim, or criterion for the good life</strong> that you <em>simply plug in every time you have a disagreement about morality</em>, then <strong>the answer is no</strong>.</p>

<p>Moving back and forth between our judgments about particular cases, events, stories, questions and more general principles that makes sense of our reasons for the positions we take on the particular cases.</p>

<blockquote><p>A conception of justice cannot be deduced from self-evident premises. Its justification is a matter of the mutual support of many considerations, of everything fitting together into one coherent view. John Rawls</p>

<p>Moral philosophy is Socratic. We may want to change our present considered judgments once their regulative principles are brought to light. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<p>Rawls thinks the method of reflective equilibrium can generate shared judgments about justice in the right, but he doesn&#8217;t think they can generate shared judgments aboit the good life, about what he call <strong>comprehensive (комплексный, всесторонний) moral and religious questions.</strong>
And the reason he thinks that, is that he says that in modern societies there is a <strong>fact of reasonable pluralism about the good.</strong> Even conscientious people who reason well, will find that they disagree about questions of the good life, about morality and religion.</p>

<p>Some people favor a libertarian theory of justice, other a more egalitarian theory of justice and they argue. And there is pluralism in our society, as between free market, laissez-faire, libertarian theories of justice, and more egalitarian ones.</p>

<p>On the liberal conception, to respect our fellow citizen&#8217;s moral and religious convictions is, so to speak, to ignore them for political purposes, to rise above, abstract from or to set aside those moral and religious convictions, to leave them undisturbed, to carry out our political debate withour reference to them.</p>

<p>Different conception of respect, according to which we respect our fellow citizen&#8217;s moral and religious convictions not by ignoring, but by engaging them, by attending to them, sometimes by challenging and contesting them, sometimes by listening and learning from them. <em>The respect of deliberation and engagement, seems to me a more adequate, more suitable ideal for a pluralist society.</em></p>
