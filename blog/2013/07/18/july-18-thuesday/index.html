<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>

<h2>Alcohol and Cancer</h2>

<p>Top 5 highest intake:</p>

<ol>
<li>Estonia (16.2 liters per year)</li>
<li>Czech Republic</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Andorra</li>
</ol>


<p>Lowest intake in Europe:</p>

<ol>
<li>Norway (6.2 liters)</li>
<li>Sweden (6.6 liters)</li>
</ol>


<p>Alcohol increases risk of cancer:</p>

<ul>
<li>esophagus</li>
<li>mouth and throat</li>
<li>pre and post menopausal breast</li>
<li>bowel cancer in men, probable in women</li>
<li>liver</li>
<li>colorectal</li>
</ul>


<p>Alcohol and Non-Cancer risks:</p>

<ul>
<li>heart disease</li>
<li>high blood pressure</li>
<li>stroke</li>
<li>osteoporosis</li>
<li>malnutrition</li>
<li>pancreatic inflammition</li>
<li>brain damage</li>
<li>liver cirrhosis</li>
<li>accidents, violence, suicide</li>
<li>birth defects if pregnant</li>
</ul>


<p>Alcohol contributes to cancer risk:</p>

<ul>
<li>damages DNA cells during alcohol breakdown</li>
<li>produces carcinogenic compounds</li>
<li>raises levels of some hormones - such as estrogen</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Drink</em> is glass of wine (5 fl oz).</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t prove cause and effect.</p>

<p>Breast cancer (n = 105k), 3-6 drinks/week - 15% more likely to develop breast cancer. For women 6-19 drinks/week increased risk was 20%. More than 19 drinks/week risk increased 50%.</p>

<h2>Debunking (разоблачение) Diet and Cancer Myths</h2>

<p>40% of cancer survivors. Common therapies:</p>

<ul>
<li>natural products</li>
<li>deep breathing</li>
<li>meditation</li>
</ul>


<p>May opt CAM works:</p>

<ul>
<li>help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain</li>
<li>comfort themself and ease the worries</li>
<li>feel that they are doing something more to help with their own care</li>
<li>try to treat or cure their cancer</li>
</ul>


<h2>Megadosing</h2>

<p>10X dose</p>

<ul>
<li>excess vitamin C -> copper deficiency</li>
<li>phosphorus -> impair calcium absorption</li>
<li>A, D, K -> toxicity</li>
<li>E -> all-cause mortality</li>
</ul>


<p><em>&#8220;Natural&#8221;</em> means nothing. Botanical products are from plants - but plants contain many chemicals and compounds. Sugar is used by all cells in the body for energy, nothing wrong with it (&#8220;sugar feeds cancer&#8221; wrong). <em>Milk</em> and low amount of <em>calcium</em> (200 mg/day) may protect against breast cancer, at levels > <em>1500 mg/day</em> may possibly <em>increase</em> prostate cancer risk.</p>

<p><em>Microwaving</em> food in plastic wrap cause cancer? There are no dioxins in plastic. Phthalates not commonly used in plastic wraps in the US. Follow manufacturer recommendations: avoid food contact with wrap if microwaving.</p>

<p><em>Reusing plastic water bottles</em> cause cancer? Most cancer experts would say that it is a perfectly safe practice.</p>

<p><em>Superfoods and ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity)</em> is very high with antioxidence (green tea, dark green leafy vege, legumes, cruciferous veg).</p>

<h2>Nutrition Need in Cancer</h2>

<p><em>Brain and Nervous system</em> - chewing and swallowing difficulties, headaches, altered taste and smell, difficulty with self-feeding.</p>

<p><em>Head and Neck</em> - swallowing difficulty, aspiration, infralmed mucosa, dry mouth, altered taste and smell</p>

<p><em>Esophagus</em> - swallowing difficulty, aspiration, obstruction, GERD, inflamed mucosa.</p>

<p><em>Stomach</em> - anorexia and early satiety, delayed stomach emptying, dumping syndrome, malabsoprion, nutrient deficiencies.</p>

<p><em>Inestine</em> - inflamed mucosa and bacterial overgrowth, obstruction, lactose intolerance, malabsorption, bile insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte imbalances.</p>

<p><em>Pancreas</em> - decrease digestive enzume secretion, bile insufficiency, malabsorption, nutrient defficiencies, hyperglycemia.</p>

<h2>Weight Loss</h2>

<p>Loss of 10% over 6 month
Anorexia in 15-25% of cancer patients at diagnosis</p>

<p>Obese - 21-25 kcal/kg
non-ambulatory or sedentary adult - 25-30 kcal/kg
who needs gain weight - 30-35 kcal/kg
cachectic, hypermetabolic - >35 kcal/kg</p>

<h2>Protein</h2>

<ul>
<li>normal 0.8 - 1.0 g/kg</li>
<li>non-sressed cancer patient - 1-1.5 g/kg</li>
<li>bone marrow transplant - 1.5 g/kg</li>
<li>extreme wasting or hypermetabolism 1.5-2.5 g/kg</li>
<li>hepatic - 0.5-0.8 g/kg</li>
</ul>


<p>A, C, folate vitamins
Fe, Mg, Zn, Cu materials</p>

<h2>Tips for increast calories and proteins in meals</h2>

<ul>
<li>butter or margarine</li>
<li>cream cheese</li>
<li>nuts</li>
<li>cream, whole milk</li>
<li>eggs</li>
<li>meats</li>

<p><strong>Justice</strong></p>

<h2>Immanuel Kant</h2>

<p>Not to use people as means even for good ends. Difficult thinker. The book is about what the supreme principle of morality is and it&#8217;s also gives us an account one of the most powerful accounts we have of what <em>freedom</em> really is.</p>

<p>Kant rejected utilitarism. He thinks that every human beings have a certain dignity (достоинство) that commands our respect. The resaon the individual is sacred or the bearer of right according to Kant, doesn&#8217;t stem from the idea that we own ourselves, but instead from the idea that we are all <em>ratinal beings</em>. Which means we are beings <em>who are capable of reason</em>. We also <em>autonomous beings</em> which is to say that we are beings capable of acting and choosing <em>freely</em>.</p>

<p>Kant admints the utilitarians were half right, we seek to avoid pain and we like plreasure. He does deny is <em>Bentham&#8217;s</em> clain that <strong>pain and pleasure are our sovereign (верховный) masters</strong>. Kant thinks that&#8217;s wrong, it&#8217;s rational capacity that makes us distinctive, that makes us special, that <em>set us apart from and above mere animal existence</em>. It makes us something more than just physical creatures with appetites.</p>

<h2>Kant about freedom</h2>

<p>When we like animals seek after pleasure or the satisfaction of our desires of the avoidance pain when we do that we arean&#8217;t really acting freely. We realy acting as the slaves of those appetites and impulses.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t choose this particular hunger or that particular appetite, and so when I act to satisfy it I&#8217;m just acting accorind to natural necessity and for Kant <em>freedom is opposite of necessity</em>.</p>

<p>obey your thirst - example with Sprite slogan. You think you choosing freely Sprite or Pepsi, but you&#8217;re actually obeying something, a thirst, or maybe a desire manufactured or messaged by advertising.</p>

<p>How can my will be detemined if not by prompting subnature or my hunger or my appetite or my desires? <em>Kant&#8217;s conception of freedom</em></p>

<p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>to act freely is to act autonomously = is to act according to a law that I give myself. (not according to the physical laws of nature or to the laws of cause and effect which include <em>my desire, to eat or to drink or to choose this food in a restaurant over that</em>)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Heteronomy</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>when I act heteronomously I&#8217;m acting according to an inclination (наклонность, склон, предрасположение) or a desire that I haven&#8217;t chosen for myself.</p></blockquote>

<p>To act <em>freely</em> is not to choose the best means to a given end - it&#8217;s to choose the end itself for its own sake. (here is example with bilard ball which according to the law of nature/law of gravity will drop on the floor and can only follow this rules, when himan being can do - choose the end itself).</p>

<p>We act as means to the realization of ends given outside us, we are instruments rather than authors of the purposes we pursue. (<em>heteronomy</em>)</p>

<p>When we act as autonomus we cease to be instruments to purposes given outside us, we become or we can come to think of ourselves as ends in ourselves. (it gives humans special dignity)</p>

<p><em>respecting human dignity</em> means regarding persons not just as means but also as end themselves (this is why it&#8217;s wrong to use people for the sake of other people well being of happiness). (this is why Kant thinks utilitarianism goes wrong, it&#8217;s important to respect the dignity of persons and to uphold (поддерживать) their rights). Freedom as autonomy.</p>

<p>What gives an action it&#8217;s moral worth? What makes an action morally worthy consists not in the conseqiences or in the results that flow from it - morally worthy has to do with the motive with the quality of the will with the intention for which the act is down and the motive must be of a certain kind.</p>

<p><strong>Kant&#8217;s conception of morality</strong></p>

<p>Moral worth of an action depens of motive (do the right thing for the right reason)</p>

<blockquote><p>A good will isn&#8217;t good because of what effects or accomplishes, it&#8217;s good in itself. Even if by utmost (все возможное) effort the good will accomplishes nothing it would still shine like a jewel for its own sake as something which has its full value in itself. Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Duty (moral worth an action is the motive of duty) <strong>VS</strong> Inclination (desires)</em></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Shopkeeper and inexperienced customer comes in, shopkepeer know that he could give the customer the wrong change. But reputation would be damaged and I would lose business, so I won&#8217;t shortchange this customer. Shopkepeer does nothing wrong, he gives a correct change, but <em>does this action have moral worth?</em> Kant says NO, because shopkepeer did it with wrong motive - out of self-interest.</p>

<p>Suicide.</p>

<p>Better bussines bureau - honest is the best policy, it&#8217;s also the most profitable.</p>
