<p><strong>THE POLITICS</strong></p>

<p>Part I and Part II about early forms of society. Man -> wife -> children, xo for the plough. Man is by nature a political animal</p>

<blockquote><p>But he who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god: he is no part of a state.</p>

<p>Justice is the bond of men in states, for the administration of justice, which is the determination of what is just, is the principle of order in political society.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Part III</h1>

<p>Managments of the houshold:</p>

<ul>
<li>master and servant, husband and wife, father and children;</li>
<li>art of getting wealth;</li>
</ul>


<p>Others affirm that the rule of a master over slaves is contrary to nature, and that the distinction between slave and freeman exists by law only, and not by nature; and being an interference with nature is therefore unjust.</p>

<h1>Part IV</h1>

<p><strong>Property</strong> is a part of the household, and the art of acquiring property is a part of the art of managing the household. The master is only the master of the slave; he does not belong to him, whereas the slave is not only the slave of his master, but wholly belongs to him. Possession may be defined as an instrument of action, separable from the possessor.</p>

<h1>Part V</h1>

<p>(about <strong>slave and master</strong>)From the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.</p>

<p>In the first place, consists of soul and body: and of these two, the one is by nature the ruler, and the other the subject.</p>

<p>The male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules, and the other is ruled; this principle, of necessity, extends to all mankind.</p>

<h1>Part VI</h1>

<p>distinction between the two classes</p>

<h1>Part VII</h1>

<p>The rule of a household is a monarchy, for every house is under one head: whereas constitutional rule is a government of freemen and equals.</p>

<p>&#8216;slave before slave, master before master&#8217;. For the master need only know how to order that which the slave must know how to execute.</p>

<h1>Part VIII</h1>

<p>Art of getting wealth. Men must all have food, and the differences in their food have made differences in their ways of life.</p>

<p>the art of acquisition - element of true riches.</p>

<h1>Part IX</h1>

<p>art of wealth-getting, and has in fact suggested the notion that riches and property have no limit.</p>

<p>a shoe is used for wear, and is used for exchange; both are uses of the shoe.</p>

<p>When the use of coin had once been discovered, out of the barter of necessary articles arose the other art of wealth getting, namely, retail trade;</p>

<p>the whole idea of their lives is that they ought either to increase their money without limit, or at any rate not to lose it.</p>

<h1>Lecture 19: The good citizen</h1>

<p>And the central idea of Aristotle&#8217;s theory of justice is that in reasoning about justice and right we have, unavoidably, to reason about the purpose, or the end, or the telos of social practice and institutions.</p>

<p>In general, it&#8217;s hard to do without <strong>teleology</strong> when we&#8217;re thinking about ethics, justice and moral argument.</p>

<p><strong>The case of politics</strong></p>

<p>how should political offices and honors, how should political rule be distributed?</p>

<p>When we discuss about politics and justice of this days, we mainly concern about the distribution of income, wealth and oportunity.</p>

<p>Artistotle took distributive justice to be mainly not about income and wealth, but about offices and honors. <strong>Who should have right to rule? Who should be a citizen? How should political authority be distributed?</strong></p>

<p>Aristotle argues that to know how political authority should be distributed we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>to inquire into the purpose, the point, the telos of politics. (Aristotle version about politics) Politics is about forming character, forming good character, it&#8217;s about cultivating the virtue of citizens. It&#8217;s about a good life.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not mere life, it&#8217;s not economic exchange only, it&#8217;s not security only, it&#8217;s realizing the good life. That&#8217;s what politics is for, according to Aristotle. Instead, for Kant and Rawls politics isn&#8217;t about making us good, it&#8217;s to respect our <strong>freedom to choose, our goods, our values, our ends, consistent with a simular liberty for others.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Aristotle disagrees with them:</p>

<blockquote><p>Any polis which is truly so called, and is not merely one in name, must devote itself to the end of encouraging <em>goodness</em>. Otherwise, political association sinks into a mere alliance.</p>

<p>Law becomes a mere covenant, a guarantor of man&#8217;s rights against one another, instead of being - as it should be - a way of life such as will make the members of a polis good and just.</p>

<p>A polis is not an association for residents on a common site, or for the sake of preventing mutual injustice and easing exchange. The end and purpose of a polis is the <strong>good life</strong>, and the institutions of social life are means to that end.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who contribute the most to an association of this character, should have a greater share in political rule and in the honors of the polis. The reason is, they are in a position to contribute most to what political community is essentially about.</p>

<p>That only by living in a polis and participating in politics do we fully realize our nature as human beings. Human beings are, by nature, meant to live in a polis. Why? It&#8217;s only in political life that we can actually exercise our distinctly human capacity for language to deliberate about right and wrong, the just and the unjust.</p>

<p>Political community is prior to the individual.</p>

<blockquote><p>A man who is isolated, who is unable to share in the benefits of political association, or who has no need to share, because he&#8217;s already self-sufficient, such a person must be either a beast or a good. Aristotle</p></blockquote>

<p>Living the life of citizen, ruling and being ruled in turn, sharing in rule, all of this is necessary to virtue. Aristotle degines happiness not as maximizing the balance of pleasure over pain, but as <strong>an acitivity</strong>, an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue.</p>

<p><strong>Virtue</strong> is only something we can acquire by practicing, by exercising the virtues. It&#8217;s the kind of thing we can learn by doing, it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t come from book learning.</p>

<p><strong>About professional golfers association should be requres to allow Casey Martin (a golfer with a disability) to ride in a golf cart</strong></p>

<p>Casey Martin ask PGA to be able to use a golf cart. PGA said no and he sued under the American for Disabilities Act, went to Supreme Court. Does Casey Martin have a right that the PGA allow him to use a golf cart on the tour?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Walking isn&#8217;t really an essential part of the game. They cited testimony saying that walking the cours consumes no more calories than you get eating a Big Mac.</p></li>
<li><p>there is no purpose, and it&#8217;s certainly not for courts to try to figure our the essential purpose of golf. Golf, like any game, is strictly for amusement and if there&#8217;s a group that want to have one version of the game - they can have that version of the game and the market can decide.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>What qualities, what excellences of persons will be honored?</p>

<h1>Reverse Bonus</h1>

<p>The binary &#8220;reverse-challenge&#8221; adopts a few anti reverse engineering (anti-debug and anti-disassembly) techniques to protect an encrypted secret. What&#8217;s the decrypted secret (hint: it&#8217;s part of the input you provide and it is not the output the program produces)?</p>

<hr />

<h1>Death: Personal Identity</h1>

<p>What is it for me to survive my death of the body? What is it for me to survive?</p>

<p>Example about Thursday lecture and next week, what is to be the same person talking to you on Thursday. Or example about 2053 (40 years later) - is that person who&#8217;s alive in 2053 the very same person as the person who&#8217;s standing here now lecturing to you. What is it for somebody in the future to be the very same person as this person who&#8217;s here.</p>

<p><strong>Identity across space</strong></p>

<p>Walking along and we see a train.</p>

<p>Car 1990 (new) &#8212;&#8212;-> Car 2000 &#8212;&#8212;> 2006 (a lot dents)</p>

<p>Think of the object extended throught time picking our by pointing to the current slice.</p>

<p>The key to personal identity</p>

<p>It&#8217;s me as long as it&#8217;s the same soul. It&#8217;s not me if it&#8217;s a different soul. If God were to replace my soul Saturday night, I die. And the thing that wakes up Sunday isn&#8217;t me.</p>

<hr />

<p>vain - напрасно
virtue - добродетель
lust - похоть
gluttony - чревоугодие
possession - владение, обладание
contemporary - современный
humdrum - банальный</p>
