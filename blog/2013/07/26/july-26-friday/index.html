<ul>
<li>Justice Lecture 20: Aristotle: Freedom vs fit</li>
<li>Week 6: The cost of cybercrime</li>
<li>Death Lecture 11: Personal Identity, Part II: The Body Theory and the Personality Theory</li>

<hr />

<p>Teleological - we first have figure out the purpose or the end of the social practice in question. Justice for Aristotle is a matter of fit.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement (that is what distinguishes games from productive activity). Justice Antonin Scalia</p>

<p>Many, indeed, consider walking to be the central feature of the game of golf. Hence, Mark Twain&#8217;s classic criticism of the sport - &#8216;a good walk spoiled&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>If justice is about fit, fitting persons to roles, matching virtues to the appropriate honors and recognition. Does it leave room for freedom? What room does teleology leave for freedom? <strong>Rawl rejects teleological accounts of justice</strong>, because he says that teleological theories of justice threaten the equal, basic rights of citizens.</p>

<p>Aristotle&#8217;s defense of slavery, which existed as an institution in the Athens of his day:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>slavery is necessary. why? if there are to be citizens who are freed from manual, and menial, and household chores to go to the assembly to deliberate about politics, there have to be some who look after those menial tasks. The mere necessities of life.</p></li>
<li><p>slave must be in fit, fit by nature. These are people who differ from ordinary people in the same way that the body differs from the soul. These are people who are meant to be ruled, and for them, their nature is best realized if they&#8217;re slaves.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you tie justice to a particular conception of the good, if you see justice is a matter of fit between a person and his or her roles, you don&#8217;t leave room for freedom. And <strong>to be free is to be independent of any particular roles, or traditions, or conventions that may be handed down by my parents, or my society.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Investigate whether the right is prior to the good.</li>
<li>Investigate what it means to be a free person, a free morally agent.</li>
</ol>

<h1>QUIZ 5</h1>

<ol>
<li>According to Aristotle, the cultivation of moral virtue arises through</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>practice</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Which of the following best represents Aristotle&#8217;s view about the role of morality in politics?</li>
</ol>


<p>Encouraging and fostering a virtuous citizenry is the primary purpose of the state.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sometimes we disagree and argue about what the telos or the purpose of a social practice really consists in. According to Aristotle, when we have those disagreements what&#8217;s at stake is</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>not just who will get what but also what qualities, what excellences of persons will be honored.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>According to Aristotle</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>the polis(the political community) exists by nature and is prior to the individual</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Casey Martin was a golfer on the PGA tour who, due to an illness, needed a golf cart to move around the course. After being denied permission to use a cart, Martin sued the PGA. Many of the tour objected to the suggestion that Martin should be allowed to use a cart. Which of the following objections to Martin&#8217;s being allowed to use the cart is an expression of teleological reasoning?</li>
</ol>


<p>Walking the course is part of the game. If you allow Martin to ride a cart, he really isn&#8217;t playing the game anymore.</p>

<h1>Death and Personal Identity</h1>

<p>Two more views regarding the metaphysical key to personal identity are discussed: the body view and the personality view. According to the <strong>body view</strong>, an individual is <em>identified in terms of his or her physical body</em>. According to the <strong>personality view</strong>, an <em>individual is identified by his or her unique set of beliefs, desires, memories, goals, and so on.</em></p>

<p>The key to being the same person is not the sameness of the soul, whether or not it exists, but rather having the very same body. Could I survive my death? If my body dies, it&#8217;s obviously answer is no. It&#8217;s at the first glance, but it could be a logical possibility of surviving the death of my body - <strong>all it takes is for my body to be put back together</strong>. God could put back moleculs back and re-create same body, <strong>bodily resurrection</strong>.</p>

<p>Example with watch. He take them apart, cleans and fix, and then reassemble them toghether. Then a week later, I come back and ask &#8220;Where&#8217;s my watch?&#8221; - Admittedly, it&#8217;s composed of all the very same pieces that made up my watch, admittedly, all these pieces are in the very same order as my watch, but still that&#8217;s not my watch. No, it&#8217;s is my watch, it was disassembled for a period of time, perhaps we should say my watch didn&#8217;t exist during that period.</p>

<p>Example <strong>tower our of wooden blocks</strong></p>

<p>Suppose that my son builds a tower our of wooden blocks. Break it, then rebuild it, every block exact at the same position as my son builds it. And then when my wife came i said &#8220;Look, this is tower that our son built.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t sound right, it&#8217;s duplicate tower.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you have an object and you take it apart and then put it all back together again, you don&#8217;t have the very same object that you started out. Van Inwagen</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The brain</strong> is the part, we now know, the brain is the part of the body that is the house of your personality, your beliefs, your desires, your fears, your ambitions, your goals, your memories</p>

<p>The crucial part of the body is sameness of brain.</p>
