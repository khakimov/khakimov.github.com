	<div class="entry-content"><p>Kant thinks that Aristotle made a mistake. It&#8217;s one thing, Kant says, to support a fair framework of rights within which people can pursue their own conceptions of the good life. It&#8217;s something else that runs the risk of coercion, to base law or principles of justice on any particular conception of the good life.</p>

<blockquote><p>In order to investigate the ideal constitution, we have first to figure out the best way to live. Aristotle</p></blockquote>

<p>Kant would reject that idea. He says that constitutions and laws and rights should not embody or affirm or promote any particular way of life. That&#8217;s at odds with freedom.</p>

<p>For <strong>Aristotle</strong>, the whole point of law, the purpose of the polis, is to shape character, to cultivate the virtue of citizens, <strong>to inculcate civic excellence, to make possible a good way of life</strong>.</p>

<p>For <strong>Kant</strong> on the other hand, <strong>the purpose of law, the point of a constitution, is not to inculcate or to promote virtue, it&#8217;s to set up a fair framework of rights within which citizens may be free to pursue their own conceptions of the good for themselves.</strong></p>

<h1>To be free person:</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Aristotle: we&#8217;re free insofar as we have the capacity to realize our potential. And that leads us to the question of fit, fit between persons and the roles that are appropriate to them. <strong>To live up to my potential</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Kant: notion of freedom as the capacity to act autonomously. Freedom means acting according to a law I give myself, freedom as autonomy. Consists in the conception of the person <strong>as a free and independent self, capable of choosing his or her own ends.</strong></p></li>
</ul>


<p>As free moral persons we are not bound by any ties of history, or of tradition or of inherited status, that we haven&#8217;t chosen for ourselves. And so we&#8217;re unbound by any moral ties prior to our choosing them and that means that we are free and independent sovereign selves. __We are the authors of the only obligations that constrain us.</p>

<p>Critics of Kant and Rawls - it misses something, it misses a whole dimension of moral life and even political life. <em>It can&#8217;t make sense of our moral experience because it can&#8217;t account for certain moral and political obligations that we commonoly recognize and even prize.</em></p>

<h1>Alasdair Macintyre:</h1>

<p><em>Narrative conception of the self</em> - man is &#8230; essentially a story-telling animal. That means I can only answer the question &#8220;what am I to do?&#8221; if I can answer the prior question of &#8220;what story or stories do I find myself a part?&#8221;</p>

<h1>Idea of community and belonging</h1>

<p>Once you accept this narrative aspect of moral reflection, you will notice that we can never seek for the good or exercise the virtues only as individuals&#8230; we all approach our own circumstatnces as bearers of a particular social identity. I am someone&#8217;s son or daughter, a citizen of this or that city. I belong to this clan, that tribe this nation.</p>

<p>Hence, what is good for me has to be the good for someone who inhabits these roles. I inherit from the past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation a variery of debts, inheritances, expectations and obligations.</p>

<p>These constitute the given of my life, my omral starting point. This is, in part, what gives my life its moral particularity.</p>

<p>It seems that narative conception of the self encumbered to some extent byt the history, the tradition, the communities of which it&#8217;s a part. We can&#8217;t make sense of our lives. Not only as a psychological matter, but also as a moral matter in thinking what we ought to do without attending to these features about us.</p>

<p><strong>From the standpoint of individualism, I am what I myself choose to be.</strong> I can&#8217;t be held responsible for what my father does or my country does or has done, unless I choose to assume such responsibility.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a blidness at odds with the fill measure of responsibility, which sometimes involves collective responsibility or responsibilities that may flow from historic memories. And example about Americans that dines any responsibility for the effects of slavery upon black Americans, saying, I never owned any slaves. Or the young German who believes that having been born after 1945 means that what Nazis did to Jews has no moral relevance to his relationship to Jews. <strong>Historical amnesia</strong></p>

<p>Once you see that who we are and what it mean to sort out our obligations can&#8217;t be separated, shouldn&#8217;t be separated, from the life histories that define us.</p>

<blockquote><p>The contrast with the narrative view of the self is clear. For the story of my life is always embeddes in the story of those communities from which I derive my identity.</p>

<p>I am born with a past, and to try to cut myself off from that past is to deform my present relationships.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Self can&#8217;t be detached, shouldn&#8217;t be detached from its particular ties of membership, history, story, narrative.</strong></p>

<p>On the liberal conception, moral and political obligations arise in one of two ways. There are natural duties that we owe human beings as such, duties of respect for persons qua persons. These obligations are universal. Then, as Rawls points out, there are also voluntary obligations that we owe to particular others insofar as we have agreed, whether through a promise or a deal or a contract.</p>

<p>Now the issue between the liberal and communitarian accounts of the self - is there another category of obligation or not?</p>

<p><strong>communitarian</strong> says there is, they argues that contruing all obligations as either natural duties or volantary obligations fails to capture obligations of membership or solidarity. Loyalties whose moral force consists partly in the fact that living by them is inseparable from understanding, ourselves as the particular persons we are.</p>

<p>Examples of obligations of membership that are particular, but not necessarily flow from consent, but rather from membership, narrative, community. Example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>relations between parents and children. Suppose there were two children drowning, one&#8217;s yours. Flip coin?</p></li>
<li><p>during world war II, French resistance pilots flew bombing raids over occupied France. One day, one of the pilot received his target and noticed that the village he was being asked to bomb was his home village. He refused, it would be special moral crime for him to bomb his people, even in a cause that he supported, that cause of liberating France. Do we admire that? If we do, the communitarian argues, it&#8217;s because we do recognize obligations of solidarity.</p></li>
<li><p>famine in Ethiopia. Hundres of thousands people was starving. The Israeli government organaized an airlift to rescue Ethiopian Jews, they didn&#8217;t have the capacity to rescue everyone in Ethiopea, and they rescued several hundred. Is that special obligation of solidarity that thus airlift properly responded to?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That takes us to the broader question of patriotism. What is difference between people that lives in Franklin, Texas and Franklin, Mexico. Accroding to the communitarian account membership does matter. And the reason <strong>patriotism is at least potentially a virtue, is that it is an expression of the obligations of citizenship.</strong></p>

<h1>Death: Peronal Identity, Part III</h1>

<p>There&#8217;s the soul view, the body view, and the personality view.</p>

<p>The <strong>body view</strong> says <em>follow the body</em>.</p>

<p>The <strong>personality view</strong> says <em>follow the personality</em>, that is, the set of beliefs, desires, memories, goals, ambitions, and so forth.</p>

<h1>Science fiction experiments </h1>

<p>from Bernard Williams. Tourture me and someone else, lets say John. Swap brains between me and John, then mad scientist asks <strong>which one should I torture?</strong> My mind in John body and of course I&#8217;ll say - tourture John mind in my body, because I don&#8217;t want to feel pain even in John body. This is me. That follows then that this intuition suggests that what I find intuitively plausible is the personality theory of personal identity.</p>

<h1>II</h1>

<p>Mad scientist asks <em>&#8220;Before I torture you, what I&#8217;m going to do is give you amnesia. I&#8217;m going to completely scrub clean your brain so that you won&#8217;t remember that you&#8217;re Ruslan, from Russia, you will not have any memories of deciding to become a nobody. You will not remember getting merried, the whole thing wiped cliean, cimplete perfect amnesia before I torture you&#8221;</em>.</p>

<p>No, no, i don&#8217;t feel better, I&#8217;m still going to be tortured. If I don&#8217;t want this thing over here to be tortured, that must be because I think it&#8217;s me. But if it&#8217;s me, what&#8217;s the key to personal identity? Well, not personality, because after all, this doesn&#8217;t end up with Ruslan&#8217;s personality before the torture. This is Ruslan&#8217;s body and that suggests if I don&#8217;t want this to be tortured, it&#8217;s because I believe in the body theory of personal identity.</p>

<p><strong>Which one should we believe?</strong></p>

<p>According to the personality theory, whether somebody is me depends on whether he&#8217;s got my beliefs. Example about insane person in asylum in Michigan who believes he&#8217;s Napoleon. Yet, the personality theory, the objection says, would tell us that he is Napoleon because he&#8217;s got the beliefs of Napoleon. He&#8217;s got Napoleon&#8217;s personality.</p>

<p><em>The personality view <strong>doesn&#8217;t say anybody who has any elements at all of my personality is me</strong>. One belief in common is obviously not enough.</em></p>

<p>We were simplifying it, getting it wrong, when we said, &#8220;Follow the personality. If you&#8217;ve got Napoleon&#8217;s personality, that&#8217;s enough to make you Napoleon.&#8221; That&#8217;s not true. We need to throw in an extra clause to deal with branching, splitting cases, of the sort that I&#8217;ve just been talking about. We need to say, if there&#8217;s somebody in the future who&#8217;s got my personality, that person is me, as long as there&#8217;s only one person around in the future who&#8217;s got my personality. If you have multiple examples, duplications, splittings and branchings, nobody, none of them is me. <strong>Seems bizarre</strong></p>
