<h1>Justice</h1>

<p>Tree differenet theory of distributed justice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Libertarian system of distribution is a system of free exchange, a free market economy</strong> against a background of formal equality, which simply means that jobs and careers are open to anyone. Carees open for talents. But still resulsts is not going to be fait, it will be biased in favor of those who happened to be born to affluent families, who happen to have the benegit of good educational opportunities. <em>And that accident of birth is not a just basis for distributing life chances.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meritocractic - fair equality of opportunity</strong>. The fastest runner will win.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Egalitarian (Democratic conception) - Rawls difference principle.</strong> People may gain, may benefit from their good fortune but only on terms that work to the advantage of the least well-off.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Objections to difference principle:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What about incentives (стимул)? Isn&#8217;t there the risk if taxes reach 70%, 80%, 90% marginal rate that Michael Jordan won&#8217;t play basketball, or CEO.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>The natural advantaged are not to gain merely because they are more gifted, but only to cover the costs of training and education and for using their endowments (пожертвования) in ways that help the less fortunate as well. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>What about effort? What about people working hard, having a right to what they earn because they deserved it? They&#8217;ve worked hard for it.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Life is not fair. It is tempting to believe that government can rectify (исправлять) what nature has spawned. Milton Friedman (book Free to Choose)</p>

<p>The natural distribution is neither just nor unjust; nor is it unjust that persons are born into society at some particular position. These are simply natural facts. What is just and unjust is the way that institutions deal with these facts. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>What about self-ownership?</li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe we don&#8217;t own ourselves in that thoroughgoing (радикальный) sense after all. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the state is an owner in me in the sence that it can simply commandeer my life, because remember the first principle we would agree to behind the veil of ignorance is <em>the principle of equal basic liberties (freedom of speech, religious liberty, freedom of conscience and the like)</em>. I own myself in the sense that I have a privileged claim on the benefits that come from the exercise of my talents in a market economy, and Rawls says on reflection, we don&#8217;t! We can defend right, we can respect the individual without embracing the idea of self-possession.</p>

<p>Example about constructors Big vs Small. Big can build wall in couple hours when Small could do same thing in couple days. Meritocracy says Big deserves to make more. It isn&#8217;t really effort, contributions matters.</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between moral deserts and entitlement?</strong></p>

<p>Consider two different games, a game of chance and a game of skill. Take a <em>game of pure chance</em> - just a game of luck, no sense in which I morally deserve to win in the first place. Ok, then let&#8217;s see <em>game of skill</em>, 49 vs raiders - it can be always asked of a game of skill, did the deserve to win?</p>

<p>Rawls says distributive justice is not a matter of moral desert, though, it is a matter of entitlements to legitimate expectations:</p>

<blockquote><p>A just scheme answers to what men are entitled to; it satisfies their legitimate expectations as founded upon social institutions. But what they are entitled to is not proportional to or dependent upon their intrinsic worth. John Rawls</p>

<p>The principles of justice that regulate the basic structure&#8230; do not mention moral desert, and there is no tendency for distributive shares to correspond to it.</p></blockquote>

<p>My talants reap in a market economy, what does it depend on? What other people happen to want or like in this society, it depends on the law of supply and demand. That&#8217;s not my doing, what counts as contributing depends on the qualities that this or that society happens to prize. <em>In a capitalist society it helps to have entepreneurial drive.</em></p>

<p>We are antitled to the benefits that the rules of the game promise for the exercises of our talents.But it&#8217;s a mistake and conceit (тщаславие, самомнение) to suppose that we deserve in the first place a society that values the qualities we happen to have in abundance (изобилии)</p>

<h1>Quiz 4</h1>

<h2>1. What is the original position?</h2>

<p>A hypothetical scenario in which people who are temporarily placed behind a veil of ignorance that covers up their knowledge about who in particular they are ( e.g. their social status and natural talents) choose the principles of justice for their society.</p>

<h2>2. What is the main function of the veil of ignorance?</h2>

<p>To ensure that people are not biased by knowledge about particular facts about themselves (e.g. how strong or intelligent they are) when thinking about matters of justice.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why, according to Rawls, is a hypothetical contract between people of equal standing who are placed behind a veil of ignorance morally more significant than an actual contract?</li>
</ol>


<p>Because it is not tainted by assymetries in bargaining power (e.g. differences in people&#8217;s wealth or intelligence or strength)</p>

<ol>
<li>Individuals who use their talents to earn an income on the free market sometimes claim that they ought to be allowed to keep all of that income because they morally deserve it. How would Rawls respond to this?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>The fact that you were born with the talents you have is a morally arbitrary fact. You do not morally deserve your talents, and so the claim that you deserve the wealth that your talents attract is dubious.</p>

<p>The fact that you were born in a society in which your particular talents are in high demand or in low supply is a morally arbitrary fact. The fact that your particular talents are in high demand or in low supply is what allows you to use those talents to become wealthy. So the claim that you deserve the wealth that your talents attract is dubious.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Rawls think that people are justified in owning the objects and wealth that they do when:</li>
</ol>


<p>The objects and wealth were acquired withint a market regulated by principles of justice that protect individual liberties and fair equality of opportunity for all and then work to the benefit of the least well-off members of society.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture 9 - Plato, Part IV: Arguments for the Immortality of the Soul</strong></p>

<p>Idestructible mean immortal. What is to be for some things being indestructible?</p>

<p>Changing is a matter of the rearrangment of the parts. If something can change it is not simple.</p>

<p><strong>Sould does indeed change</strong>. One day you believe, for example, that it&#8217;s hot, next day it&#8217;s cold. Desire to learn piano and then give up about it.</p>

<p>Soul is simple? In Republic Plato argues that <strong>soul not simple at all</strong> (three parts, rational, spirited, appetite).</p>

<p>Simple can&#8217;t destroy, because they don&#8217;t have parts and you can&#8217;t take them apart. But what about if just <em>goes our of existence</em></p>

<p>Haromny of the harp, like mind to the body. Harmony is something that gets produced by a well-tuned instrument, the soul or the mind is something that gets produced by well-tunned body.</p>

<h1>Plato says:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Harmony crearly cannot exist before the existence of the harp itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Harmony can vary (melodiosly of harp). The mental aspect can come in degree, intelligence, creativity, reasonbless and like.</p></li>
<li><p>Soul can be good or it can be evil. Harmonious soul? Looks strange, but we say mind/soul is like the harmony.</p></li>
<li><p>Soul is capable to directing your body. Your soul can opposed your body. Function of the body can wiggle my finger, my mind give instruction my body (my brain give instruction to other part of my body - fingers). As melody can affect the harp.</p></li>
