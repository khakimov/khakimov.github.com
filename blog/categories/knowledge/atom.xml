    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two person who were important for contemporary philosophy Ralph Waldo Emerson and Ludwin Wittgenstein. Emerson is a key figure in American intellectual history, cultural history, but until pretty recently wasn't seen as a key figure in philosophy. Often flowery (витиеватый) writer, he is a writer of wonderful sentences one of the most quotable authors in American history. Emerson's philosophical contribution to American culture as an author whose importance rivals that of Nietzsche and of Heidegger both of whom were influenced by Emerson.</p>

<p>Emerson was born during the presidency of Thoman Jefferson, so very early in the nineteenth century, lived a long life, he was at some point a minister and left the pulpit, because of a crisis of faith, not so much in the divine being but in instritutionalized religion and became an eassayst and lecturer. Emerson had audiences of thousands of people around the contry who were following his intellectual excursions via lectures in towns across the United States. His departure from enlightenment tradition as it had been imported into the United Stated is really key.</p>

<p><em>The englightenment tradition in the United States was very much indebted to the Lockian Tradition, that is the view that all our ideas come from sensations that we are receptacle of stimuli from the world and that our ideas and then our belief and our work comes as we process the stimulation, the sensation that comes into us. In some ways, thinking of us as a blank slate and having these impressions made upon us by the world.</em> That's the tradition that the American progressive thinkes the beginning of the 19th century adopted.</p>

<p>Emerson has a different view, his view is kind of an activist mind, for him, experience isn't just receiving the world. Emerson's view is that the mind goes out into the world, we make our experience in an active way (something there from Kant). <strong>Experience comes not by just humans being receptacles, but humans creating experience by actively living in the world.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Grief too will make us idealists. In the death of my son, now more than two years ago, I seem to have lost a beautiful estate, — no more. I cannot get it nearer to me. If tomorrow I should be informed of the bankruptcy of my principal debtors, the loss of my property would be a great inconvenience to me, perhaps, for many years; but it would leave me as it found me, — neither better nor worse. Experience by Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

<p> Life is a train of moods like a string of beads, and, as we pass through them, they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue, and each shows only what lies in its focus.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are times in our lives when we think that we are living a kind of banal existence. Everything is routine, that you know there, we go to work everyday or we go to school everyday, we have our meals at the same time, we see the same members of our family, our friends, our spouses, our lovers, whatever we're depending on our situation. And after while we've realized we're not feeling things. It's just going thorought life, going through the motions we might say. <strong>And sometimes we want a crisis, you want something big to happen, even if it's a bad thing, because it makes feel more alive, more vital.</strong></p>

<p>If you had some crisis, if you had a grief, you would at least wake up to the world, because you're living in the world without waking up to it. But grief will make us idealists. There are times when we think that we are away from the world and we hope that some huge even happens, even a horrible event, that will make us at least, feel the world.</p>

<p>But in fact, <strong>it's a mistate to think you need some huge experience, some trauma, to wake you up to the world.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>We animate what we can, and we see only what we animate.</p></blockquote>

<p>We make the world alive to us. We enliven the world.</p>

<h2>[Human Kind] The Direction of History</h2>

<p>The interaction between different societies tooks all kind of forms, there were of course wars, trades, immigration from one society to the other, religion missionaries coming from one place to another.</p>

<p><strong>Does human history has a clear direction?</strong></p>

<p>All wars, trades, immigrations in history have a clear general direction and this direction is global unity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>It was a splendid mind. For if thought is like the keyboard of a piano, divided into so many notes, or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty-six letters all in order, then his splendid mind had one by one, firmly and accurately, until it had reached, say, the letter Q. He reached Q. Very few people in the whole of England ever reach Q... But after Q? What comes next?</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Web of love</strong> connects one with the other, not a logical deduction, but an intimacy born of affection and art.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the meaning of life? That was all - a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years. The great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.</p></blockquote>

<h2>There is No Justice in History. Part 4</h2>

<p>The most common theory, which tries to explain the patriarchal system, points out that men are physically stronger than women and that men have used the greater physical force, physical power to force women into submission. That means men could monopolize certain economic tasks that demand hard manual labor, like plowing the fields and harvesting wheat or rice or whatever it is. And this gave men <strong>control of food production</strong> and gave them control of the economy which in turned translated into political power.</p>

<p>Problems of this theory: First of all the statement that men are stronger than women is true only on average and also it is true only with regard to certain types of strngths. Secondly, and more importantly, there simple is no direct relation between physical strength and social power smong homo sapiens, among humans.</p>

<p>Another theory explains that the dominance of men over women results not just from strength, but from something which is more complacted, <strong>from aggression</strong>. According to this theory, for millions of years of evolution, men have been evloving to become willing to engage in physical violence much more than women, and this is why throughout history warfare was a monopoly of mainly of men. Men -> war -> control civil society</p>

<p>Now recent studies indeed indicate that the hormonal and cognitive systems of men and women are somewhat different and that men, by nature, becuse of that more violent, more willing to use physical violence against others and therefore men are really better suited to serve as common soldiers than women.</p>

<p>The third most common theory for the rise of patriacrchal societies explain that through millions of years of evolution men and women evolved different survival and reproduction strategies. Men, competed with one another, for access to fetile women, for the opportunity to impregnate the women; therefore, if you wre a man your chance of reproducing and passing your genes to the next generation, depended above all on your ability to defeat other men, and to outperfom other men. A women on the other hand had no problem finding a man that was willing to impregnate her. However if the woman wanted her children to provide her with grandchildren she needed to carry them in her womb for nine long months and then nurture them and take care of them for years because it was not enought just to be impregnated. During all that time of pregnancy and child care woman had fewer opportunities to obtain food and woman reguired a lot of help. In order to ensure the survival of yourself and your children woman need a man.</p>

<p>According to this theory, as time went by, the feminine genes that made it to the next generation therefore belonged to the woman who were the most submissive caretakes, who agreed to everything the man wanted and who spent most of the time just taking care of the children. <em>The result of these different survival strategies according to the theory is that men have been programmed by millions of years of evolution to be ambitious and competitive and to excel in politics and business and so forth.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Incapacity for belief. Critical thinking as being so important, how teaching people how to be critical and so that they actually will never fall for something that somebody else is selling them in less than sound way. But what happenes is you're so good at being ironic and critical or distant is you never have the capacity to like anything or to have strong affection for things because strong affection is usually not based in reason.</p>

<h2>There is No Justice in History</h2>

<p>The Bible says in Deuteronomy chapter 22, verses 28 to 29:</p>

<blockquote><p>If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed to anybody and seizes her and lies with her and they are found then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young women 50 sheckels.</p></blockquote>

<p>Child bearing, for example. has been considered woman's job in all human societies in history, for the simple reason that men don't have wombs. However, around this kind of hard kernel of universal biological differences between men and women, every society that we know of in history, managed to accumulate many cultural ideas and norms that have very little to do with biology. Societies associate a host of qualities and tasks and duties with masculinity (мужественность) and with femininity.</p>

<p>Chimpanzees use sex in order to cement political alliances, establish intimacy and diffuse tensions between individuals in the band and that doesn't result in the birth of little chimpanzees.</p>

<p><strong>Masculinuty</strong> - what you need to do, how you need to behave and talk and walk and dress in order to be a man. And this changes a lot from one culture to the other culture.</p>

<p>Males spend much of their lives engaged in all kinds of dramas and conflicts and competitions, just in order to prove that they are real man. And success is not guaranteed. Both females and males may fail to win a claim as real men and real women. Throughout the all of human history males have been willing to risk and even to sacrifice their lives, just so that people would say about them he is a real man.</p>

<p>No matter how a society define what it is to be a real man, and what is it to be a woman, to be a man was always better. This is what scholars mean when they speak about patriarchal societies and patriarchy.</p>

<p><strong>A patriarchai society</strong> is a society that values what is sees as masculine qualities more than it values what is considers to be feminine qualities. They educate males to be men; to think and act in a masculine way. But women, of course, they are still supposed to think and act and dress in a feminine way, and anyone who tries to change it will be punished. But patriarchai society doesn't reward men and women equaly. It rewards successful men with much more power and many more privileges than it rewards successful women.</p>

<p>With very few exceptions all known human societies in history, at least since agricultural evolution, were patriarchai societies.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Art, Loss, and Forgiveness</h2>

<p>Read <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91t/">To the lighthouse</a> by Virginia Woolf.</p>

<p><strong>Virgina Woolf</strong> was part of a group that has stimulated the imagination of historians and literary critics for a long time, the <em>Bloomsbury group</em>. They saw middle class morality as hypoctritical in many cases and they wanted to go beyond that, although they were very much middle class, they go beyond convention in terms of friendship, in terms of sexuality, in terms of art making, to find something that would be more meaningful and less violent and less hypoctritical.</p>

<p>Intrinsic goods like friendship, beauty, art, love stood on their own and commitment to them structured your other beliefs, rather than your other beliefs leading you to have a commitment to friendship or love or beauty.</p>

<p>Moore was an analytic philosopher. But one of the things he tried to show was that no matter how much precision you use, how much <strong>scientifically</strong> organized argument you use, <strong>you could not actually define the good.</strong></p>

<p>Goodness is indefinable, goodness is not reducible to anything else.
Learning to draw, to play the piano, to read a poem didn't have to be justified in terms of how much money you would make later on. Because actually no one says that making money is the highest good. And Moor and the the Bloomsbury group said no, no, art is its own thing, it doesn't have to be justified in other terms, so too friendship, so too love.</p>

<hr />

<h2>There is No Justice in History</h2>

<p>Your classify people into several different categories and then treat people according to the category to which they belongs without really bothering to know who they are and what their true abilities and true personality is.</p>

<p>For example, in traditional Hindu society if you are going to marry, say, you're looking for a potential bride or groom. The first thing and mose important thing that you want to know about this person, your potential husband or wife is to which caste they belong.</p>

<p>Similarly, today in the world capitalists believe that the reason hierarchy of wealth and this hierarchy of wealth reflects real differences in the ability and qualities of people. Capitalists at least, many of them believe that the rich have more money and privileges because they are more intelligent and hard working and this is how they became rich. So according to the capitilist no one should be bothered if the rich get better health care, better education and nutrition because they have earned it.</p>

<p>Most of the abilities of people have to be nurtured and developed even if somebody is born with a particular talent. Like playing football, or doing business. That talent will usually remain latent if it is not fostered and exircised. And not all people in a particular society get the same chance to cultivate and exercise their abilities. Weather or not they will have an opportunity to do so will usually depend on their place within the imagined hierarchy of that society.</p>

<p>Even if people belonging to different classes somehow develop exactly the same abilities, still they are unlikely to enjoy equal chances of success because they will have to play the game by different rules.</p>

<p>People have been given by a long evolutionary process a fear of polluting themselves by coming in contact with all kinds of things that might cause them diseases, like dead bodies, rotten corpses or bad food. Then, all kinds of religions and social systems "hijacked" this biological mechanisms of developing disgust towards something and turned it agains certain groups of people.</p>

<p>Racial system in American was caused by European invasion and conquest of America in the early modern period, and more importantly, the importation by the European conquerors of millions of African slaves to work in the mines and plantations of America.</p>

<p><strong>Why they didn't employ simple the local indians</strong> is that the Europeans brought with them a lot of unfamiliar illnesses, diseases, to American and the Indians died in millions. More than 90% of the population of the America, died within a century of the arrival of Europeans. So they had to import people from someplace else to work in mines.</p>

<p><strong>Why they didn't employ people from Europe or India or China?</strong> <strong>First</strong> of all, Africa was closer to American than Asia, so it was cheaper to import slaves from Senegal than to import slaves from Vietnam. <strong>Secondly</strong>, in Africa was already existed a very well developed slave trade. Mainly muslim slave traders North Africa and the Middle East developed in the previous centuries a lively trade in African slaves which were exported from Central Africa to North Africa and the Middle East. <strong>Third</strong>, and most important reason, is that American plantations of sugar, cotton, coffee and so forth, were mostly located in tropical areas of America. Like Tahiti and Brazil, Lousiana and Virginia. And these tropical areas were plagued by tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever which had originated in Africa. So, African had immune to this diseases and it was much better for investors buying an African slave who was already resistant to malaria and yellow fever, than buying, say, an Irish slave who would die within six months.</p>

<p>European theologians said that Africans descended from Ham, son of the biblical Noah and Ham was cursed by his father Noah that his offspring would be slaves. And this is why it's okay to enslave Africans.</p>

<p>One of the sad truths about history is that over time, unjust discrimination against a particular group of people often gets worse, not better. Money, very often comes to money, and poverty comes to poverty. Most sociopolitical hierarchies in human history, they lack any objective biological and logical basis. They are nothing but a perpetuation of accidental events which are supported by imagined stories that people invented over time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Food alone is not enough, you also need an imagined order, but we need one more thing - technique for storing and processing huge amounts of information. After Agricultural Revolution as human societies began to grow larger and larger, who things happened.</p>

<p>First, the amounts of necessary information grew (run village with 5000 people versus band with 50). Second, if you really want to run a big town or kingdom, you need to store and process not only larger amounts of information but also a completely new kinds of infromation, for which the average human brain is ill-adopted - <strong>monotonous mathematical data (numbers)</strong>. Mathematical data is vital (taxes, debt, fines, credit).</p>

<p>Writing is a method for storing and processing information and by using not our neurons in the brain, but by using material signs of all kinds and shapes. Writing was invented not in order to write poetry or philosophy with history because this could be done withour writing. The purpose was to store and process mathematical data for which the Sumerians invented the first script, the first system of writing.</p>
