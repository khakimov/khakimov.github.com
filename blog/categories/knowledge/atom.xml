    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>History's biggest fraud</h2>

<p>First theory: The process of domestication of animals may have begin with selective hunting.</p>

<p>Second theory: When hunters caught and adopted a little lamb, fattening it for some weeks or months when there was plenty of food and they killed and ate it.</p>

<p>Domesticatated animals also spread around the world with people.</p>

<p>10 000 years there are not more than a few million sheep, a few million cattle, goats, pigs and chicken and that they are mostly restricted to to certain area in Afro-Asia.</p>

<p>Today in contrast, the world contains about <strong>1 billion sheep, 1 billion pigs, 1.5 cattle, 25 billion chickens.</strong> So for a narrow evolutionaty perspective, which measures the success of a species by the number of DNA copies the agrocultural revolution was a wonderful success for checkens and cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.</p>

<p>Farmers in certain societies in New Guinea, what they did is to slice off, to cut a part of the nose of the pig. And this causes the pig a severe pain whenever he tries to sniff around.</p>

<p>Cows, goats and sheep produce milk only after they give birth to caives and kids and lambs. And only as long as these youngsters are suckling because the milk of cows, it is meant to feed the children of the cow. In order to ensure continues supply of animal milk, a farmer need all the time to have cows and kids and little lambs for suckling.</p>

<p><strong>Agrocultural revolution was a huge success from the point of evolutionary proccess, but it was catastrophe for cows, chickens and pigs as individuals.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>Strong arguments don't always persuade everyone</h2>

<p>Religious and cultural beliefs can be too hard to overcome. So even the best arguments can have disbelievers. Human beings aren't always logical and don't always believe scientifically proven cause and effect.</p>

<p>A valid, strong and sound argument in and of itself may never persuade or convert anyone to adpt a different way of thinking. So what. What a strong argument does is to communicate clearly what one think and why they think it.</p>

<p>Don't set your sights too high. If your goal is to persuade everybody, you're going to be <strong>constantly frustrated</strong>.</p>

<h2>What else Arguments used for? Explanation</h2>

<p>You can use Arguments in order to explain things. <strong>Explaining</strong> is gigivng a reason why something happened (or why it is true).</p>

<p>When you justify something, your audience <strong>might not believe</strong> what you are justifying.</p>

<p>When you explain something, you and your audience both <strong>believe</strong> what you are explaining.</p>

<blockquote><p>The goal of explanation is to help people understan why something is true.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kinds of Explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Causal</strong>: <em>Why did the bridge collapse? The earthquake shook it.</em></li>
<li><strong>Teleological</strong> (purpose): <em>Why did Joe go to the grocery store? To buy milk.</em></li>
<li><strong>Formal</strong>: <em>Why doesn't this peg fit in that round hole? The peg is square.</em></li>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: <em>Why is this golf club light? It is made of graphite.</em></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this part we're going to talk about the question why people move towards wheat? It's not offer people economic security, not good for the diet, because has less mineral and vitamins, hard to digest and bad for our teeth. The life of a peasant is usually less secure than the life of a hunter gatherer, they gather, hunt and eat a lot of of different food.</p>

<p>Chance of the men to die at the hand of another man was 25% in ancient agricultural village say 8 000 years ago. Today in the world it's about 1.5% - 1%, even less.</p>

<p>Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory for a given field. Homo sapiens <strong>could get much more food if we used agriculture than if we hunted and gather what frows naturally in that field.</strong> Extra food enable the number of Sapiens to grow exponentially.</p>

<p><em>Evolutionary success of a specie is measured only by the number of copies of DNA in existence.</em> Because of extra food, villages and connection to the one place woman could have a child every year instead of having baby just every three or four years as was the case with hunter gatherers (woman were very careful to wait until the previous child could walk before having another baby).</p>

<p>Moreover, infectious diseases began to spread rapidly (from domesticated animals to people, problems with toilet and garbage piles, diet was worse and immune system was less robust)</p>

<p>Population kept growing and growing all the time, and therefore, even if people wanted to go back from agruculture back to the hunting and gathering, they can't because they have much more people to feed. So they kept watering the wheat firlds and feeding all "extra" people.</p>

<p><strong>The disire to have a better and easier life actually treapped human kind in harder living conditions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Luxuries tend to become necessities.</strong> Once people get used to a certain habit, they begin to count on it and to take it for granted and eventually they reach the position when they can't live without it.</p>

<p>Example with email vs post mail. It obviously very good and easy to be able to send something and get response very fast versus sending the message with envelope and stamps on it and get the answer in weeks or even month. The life of people who use emails is not more easy and more relaxed than the life of people who used only letters.
Humanity search for an easier life, releases immense forces of change which tranform the world in ways that nobody envisioned or wanted. It's extremely difficult to foresee all the results of our actions and all the factors which in order to make really good decisions, we need to tak into account.</p>

<p>Alternative explanation about agricultural revolution. It suggests that what brought about the agricultural revolution was not the search for an easier and more comfortable life, rather, it was the attempt to fulfil some kind of cultural or religious aspiration.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What are Arguments used for?</h2>

<p><strong>Persuading</strong> is making people believe or do something that they would not otherwise believe or do.</p>

<p><strong>Justifying</strong> is showing someone a reason to believe the conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Justification</strong> tries to give good reasons. <strong>Persuasion</strong> tries to change your belief or actions (and bad reasons can do that).</p>

<p>When someone give you an argument, you need to ask a series of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the arguer trying to <strong>change</strong> someone's mind? If so, the purpose is <strong>persuasion</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the arguer trying to give some kind of <strong>reason</strong> to believe something? If so, the purpose is <strong>justification</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>History's Biggest Fraud</h2>

<p>If things were so good at the time of the hunter gatherers, why did the agricultural revolution happen?</p>

<p>For the first 2.5 millin years of their existence, human managed very well without agriculture. They fed themselves by gathering plant and by hunting animals that lived and bread <strong>without</strong> much human intervention.</p>

<p>About <strong>12 000 years ago</strong> sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to manipulate the lives of a few animal and plant species. Like wheat or potatoes or chicken or cows, from sunrise to sunset, sewed seeds and watered plants, and plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to pasture.</p>

<p>That leads to the agricultural revolution, transition from a life of hunting and gathering to a life of controlling and cultivation plants and animals ofccured for the first time around <strong>9000 BC</strong> in southeastern Turkey, western Iran and Levant (scholars once believed that agriculture began only this area in the Middle East and from there spread all around the world, but this theory is <strong>no longer accepted</strong>. Today scholars agree, that agriculture sprang up in several different parts of the world independently).</p>

<p>Agricultural revoltion was a great leap forward for human kind. It's wrong to think that the agricultural revoltion began because people became smarter and discovered things about animals and plants that they didn't know before.</p>

<p>Compared with lives of most peasants, the ancient hunter gatherers enjoyed a better life, they enjoyed a healthier diet, they worked fewer hours and they spent their time doing much more interesting things than the peasants. Also they were less in danger of starvation, of disease and probably even less in danger of human violence.</p>

<p>The average peasant in the small village, he or she worked harder than the average forager thousands of years prevously. And they got in return a worse diet. <em>The agricultural revolution from this prospective turns out to be the biggest fraud in history.</em></p>

<p>Meat covers almost 2.25 million square km of the globe's surface. How did it turn wheat from being insignificant to be ubiquitous, everywhere? <strong>Wheat did it by manipulating homo sapiens!</strong></p>

<p>The human body is not adapted to all this back breaking toil, to all this clearing rocks and weeding of fields and carrying water buckets from the river. Human body paid for all this effort with a very high price.</p>

<p>Also, people were forced to settle permanently next to the wheat field and this completely changed their way of life. From nomadic foragers, human turned into peasants living in a village in one place. <strong>Wheat domisticated us</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Paintings. We're starting off with Eugene Delacroix was born just after the French Revolution in 1798 and he lives on to 1863.</p>

<p>Art should lead to heightened emotion within a bourgeois sphere, middle class sphere.</p>

<hr />

<h2>ThinkAgain</h2>

<p>Professor name is Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. He going to teach me how to reason and argue. Think more deeply. We going approach reason by <strong>arguments, because arguments are just ways to express reasons.</strong> And if you can understand arguments, you can understand reason.</p>

<p>Good Arguments => Good Reason for the ways which you think and behave.</p>

<p>Understand arguments helps to avoid mistakes.</p>

<ol>
<li>How to analyze arguments (which passages includes arguments)</li>
<li>How to evaluate deductive arguments (propositional and categorical logic)</li>
<li>How to evaluate inductive arguments (generalization, application, inference to the best explanation, causal reasoning, decision making)</li>
<li>How to avoid fallacies (vagueness неопределенность, ambiguity, irrelevance, begging the question)</li>
</ol>


<p>You can't win an argument just by <strong>yelling</strong> at someone. That doesn't make the argument any better because that's not the point of arguing.</p>

<p>You can't win an argument simply by <strong>calling your opponent a stupid git</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Complainings</strong> just  expressing your emotion about the situation.</p>

<p><strong>An argument</strong> is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition. Sometimes arguments are intended to stablish a propostion, but in other cases they're intended to help us understand the proposition and the reasons why the proposition is true.</p>

<p><strong>Argument:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>a series of sentences, statements, or propositions</li>
<li>where some are the premises</li>
<li>and one is the conclusion</li>
<li>where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion.</li>
</ol>
