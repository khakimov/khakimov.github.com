    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today went to the park in Downtown Palo Alto, nice place to test my pilot skills. It was not bad, couple times I did wrong with direction (coulnd't spin around the axle, get lost the control). Spin around the axle is going to be my next exercise, because I can fly back and forth, but can't turn around and fly with same side. Anyway, that was cool, almost 20 minutes of disconnected from the world.</p>

<p>Of course this is not the end and I'm going to improve this aircraft. I'm thinking about couple really awesome things, like glasses + camera on quadrocopter:</p>

<p>or (good one in my case)</p>

<p>NAZA controller with GPS module</p>

<p>ps: quadrocopter + kinect</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Was an interesting quest to build this thing. At the end I've almost gave up about even test drive it and couple weeks it just waited till my friend asked to try outside, because I've tried to test it at home and it wasn't good idea (no pilot expirience, didn't know how to controls work and tried to start with perfect vertical lift-off and of course it didn't work and I thought something wrong with my hands/software/engines/controllers). <em>An old story, we are afraid to fail at something, so it was really easy to give up than just once test it outside.</em></p>

<p>Anyway, I did it and it flies perfectly. Time to improve pilot/control skills and later will upgrade it with camera and maybe with 3d glasses.</p>
