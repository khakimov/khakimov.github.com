    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is Sunday and as usually I spent this day reading and hacking. K&amp;R for sure is a best book ever if you want to understand C and the most important part is exercises. Very interesting and useful. But today I will not talk about programming, I want to introduce new version of this blog with new design and one feature which, I hope, will provide more interactive.</p>

<p>I'm not crazy and understand nobody read this and this lines I wrote only for myself, but anyway it sounds interesting, why not to try?</p>

<p>I added function to be able to comment any part of post, even just one word. I think this is going to be very useful to comment some code. Double click on any text and will see [comment] button, like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://pix.am/yM4z.png" alt="Example screenshot with comment button" /></p>

<p>```ruby
require 'eventmachine'</p>

<p> module EchoServer
   def post_init</p>

<pre><code> puts "-- someone connected to the echo server!"
</code></pre>

<p>   end</p>

<p>   def receive_data data</p>

<pre><code> send_data "&gt;&gt;&gt;you sent: #{data}"
 close_connection if data =~ /quit/i
</code></pre>

<p>   end</p>

<p>   def unbind</p>

<pre><code> puts "-- someone disconnected from the echo server!"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<h1>Note that this will block current thread.</h1>

<p>EventMachine.run {
  EventMachine.start_server "127.0.0.1", 8081, EchoServer
}
```</p>

<p>I'm also want to share interesting posts I reading during the day with my thoughts and comments. Mostly from <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a> and <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a>. Will see how it will work, some examples what I'm reading on <strong>quora</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Sleep/What-is-the-ideal-time-to-go-to-bed">What is the ideal time to go to bed?</a>.</p></li>

<p>Any ideas/thought/sugestions?</p>
