    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've realized what I have bunch of emails where I've send people "bugs" on their websites (I'll share here only that already fixed "bugs"). As example, once I've read about startup http://1.ai on HN. I thought such a nice domain name and interesting .ai zone =) Couple checks and pretty annoy xss:</p>

Hey guys,</p>

<p>Read about you on HN, first of all thanks for the great job and don't
forget to close xss here
http://1.ai/%3Cimg%20src=%22http://i.imgur.com/aAJSR.jpg%22%3E</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>just after that i've got email:</p>

<p>{% blockquote %}
Hello Ruslan,
thank you for your help - will notify the sysadmin asap :)
Enjoy the account and feel free to let me know if you do have suggestions/security ideas.
At the moment beside relatively small things the permissions and security should guarantee that
everything runs smoothly but we will certainly do more fixes (like this one) over time !
best Regards
David

<p>That's cool when people response very fast and with positive feedback, usually people just ignore emails like this, I have no idea why. Maybe because it seems strange, maybe they don't care about that till time when somebody use it.</p>
