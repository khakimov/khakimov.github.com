    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>That's not a secret that I in love with security and I'm using some applications on a regular basis to protect my security such as vpn when using public wifi or https everythere where it is possible. HTTPS is not a holy Grail, but often https is enough to secure facebook or gmail connection. Of course I know about DNS changer/spoof or force HTTP session insted HTTPS which attackers use often and that's why I'm using also <strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kb-ssl-enforcer/flcpelgcagfhfoegekianiofphddckof/details">KB SSL Enforcer</a></strong>.</p>

<p>KB SSL Enforcer helps automatically detects if a site supports SSL and redirects you to it. Also it blocks insecure content when you load page over ssl and something on this page has insecure css/js/image.</p>

<p>Security can be compromised completely by an active atacker exploiting a simple mistake such as loading css, image or Flash banner over an insecure connection. For instance,</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ehow.com/">ehow.com</a>
<img src="http://pix.am/bFrO.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>so on and so on... Problem is very simple - <strong>hardcoded http://</strong> links.</p>

<p><strong>Solution?</strong> Please, don't use hardcoded http:// if you have http and https! I hope having https version is going to be as a standard and this is really good news "<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</a>". This RFC was approved couple days ago, read it and don't forget to check your website!</p>
