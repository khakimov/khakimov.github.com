    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've realized what I have bunch of emails where I've send people "bugs" on their websites (I'll share here only that already fixed "bugs"). As example, once I've read about startup http://1.ai on HN. I thought such a nice domain name and interesting .ai zone =) Couple checks and pretty annoy xss:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Hey guys,</p></p><p><p>Read about you on HN, first of all thanks for the great job and don't<br/>forget to close xss here<br/>http://1.ai/%3Cimg%20src=%22http://i.imgur.com/aAJSR.jpg%22%3E</p></p><p><p>thanks</p></p><p><p>-rus</p></blockquote></p>

<p>just after that i've got email:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Hello Ruslan,<br/>thank you for your help - will notify the sysadmin asap :)<br/>Enjoy the account and feel free to let me know if you do have suggestions/security ideas.<br/>At the moment beside relatively small things the permissions and security should guarantee that<br/>everything runs smoothly but we will certainly do more fixes (like this one) over time !<br/>best Regards<br/>David</p></blockquote></p>

<p>That's cool when people response very fast and with positive feedback, usually people just ignore emails like this, I have no idea why. Maybe because it seems strange, maybe they don't care about that till time when somebody use it.</p>
