<hr />

<p>Suppose there are two candidates who did equally well on the tests and grades, both of whom went to first-rate schools. Among those candidates, would it be unfair for the college or univesity to say we still want diversity along racial and ethnic dimensions, even where we are not correcting for the effects on test scores of educational disadvantage.</p>

<p><em>Legacy admissions</em> is giving an advantage to someone who has an arbitraty privilege of their parent having attended the univesrity to which they&#8217;re applying.</p>

<h1>Arguments for Affirmative Action:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>One argument has to do with correcting for the effects of educational disadvantage. <strong>Corrective</strong> - <em>correcting for differences in educational backgrounds.</em> That argument is consistent in principle with the idea that only academic promise and scholarly potential should count in admissions. We just need to go beyond test scores and grades alone to get a true estimate of academic promise and scholarly ability.</p></li>
<li><p>Affirmative action is justified even where there may not be the need to correct for educational disadvantage in a particular applicant&#8217;s case. <strong>Compensatory</strong> - <em>compensating for past wrongs.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversity</strong> - (different from compensatory, because it makes a certain appeal to the social purpose or the social mission of the college or univesity) Two arguments:</p></li>
<li><p><em>for educational experience for everyone</em></p></li>
<li><em>for society as whole</em> (we need to train lawyers, and judges, and leaders, public officials who will contribute to the strength, the civic strength of the state of Texas and the country as whole)</li>
</ol>


<p>When reviewing the large number of candidates able to do well in our classes race may count as a plus, just as coming from Iowa may count or being a good middle linebacker or pianist.</p>

<p>A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something a white student cannot offer. The quality of the educational experience of all students depends in part on these differences in the background and outlook that students bring with them.</p>

<h1>Mobile Malware</h1>

<h2>Two layers:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dalvic VM (sms send/recv)</li>
<li>OS interaction (read/write files)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Static:</h1>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>many info in the Manifest</li>
<li>java is relatively easy to decompile</li>
<li>potentially sees the whole behavior</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>obfuscation and optimizations</li>
<li>reflection</li>
<li>dynamic code, native code</li>
</ul>


<h1>Dynamic:</h1>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>resilient to obfuscation</li>
<li>potentially transparent (VMM)</li>
<li>less comples than static</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>code coverage</li>
<li>VMI can be cumbersome (громоздкий) (VMM)</li>
<li>instrumental can be detected</li>
</ul>


<h1>CopperDroid</h1>

<p>Unified dynamic analysis technique to characterize the behavior of android malware.</p>

<ol>
<li>automatically reconstruct the behaviors</li>
<li>system call centric analysis</li>
<li>android version independent</li>
<li>dynamically stimulates apps to disclose additional behaviors</li>
</ol>


<h1>System calls on Linux ARM</h1>

<p>Like on Intel, on ARM architecture invoking a system call induces a user-to-kernel transiction.</p>

<ul>
<li>On ARM invoked through the <em>swi</em> instruction</li>
<li><em>r7</em> contains the number of the invoked syscall</li>
<li><em>r0-r5</em> contain parameters</li>
<li><em>lr</em> contains the return address</li>
</ul>


<p>System call analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>intercept when a syscall is invoked</li>
<li>we need to intercept return to user-space too!</li>
<li>there is no SYSEXIT/SYSRET to intercept</li>
<li>not every syscall actually returns to <em>lr</em> (exit, execve)</li>
</ul>


<p>CopperDriod&#8217;s Approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>instruments QEMU&#8217;s emulation of the swi instruction</li>
<li>instruments QEMU to intercept every cpsr_write (Kernel -> User)</li>
</ul>


<p>CopperDroid VMI:</p>

<ul>
<li>process name</li>
<li>pid and tid</li>
<li>process resources</li>
</ul>


<p>when executing kernel code, the <em>base</em> of the stack points to the current executing thread.</p>

<p>Binder protocol is the core of Android IPC/RPC</p>

<ul>
<li>intents are carried through binder</li>
<li>interactions with the system go through binder</li>
<li>binder driver enforces (some) permission policies</li>
</ul>


<p>Application cannot send SMSs on their own, but must invoke (RPC) the proper system service to do that.</p>

<p>Android malware needs to be properly stimulated to trigger more malicious behaviors and increase coverage of dynamic analysis.</p>

<p>CopperDroid Ad-Hoc Stimuli</p>

<ol>
<li>Identifies events the target reacts to (mostly contained in the Manifest file)</li>
<li>During the analysis, injects customs evenets (of those identified as useful)</li>
</ol>


<p>MonkeyRunner to inject events.</p>

<p>CopperDroid - automatically reconstruct the behaviors of android malware.</p>

<h1>Plato with arguments for the immortality of the Soul</h1>

<p>Suppose I pluck a string on my harp, producing a certain note. As we know, the vibrations of one string can set into play the other strings vibrating as well. That would be analogous to what goes on when my mind affects my body.</p>

<p><strong>An essential property</strong> is a property that a given object must have; it always has as long as it exists at all.</p>

<p><strong>A contingent property</strong> is a property that an object may have, may happen to have its entire existence, but could&#8217;ve existed without.</p>

<p>My car is blue (contingent property), it could be red, but the car will still exist. It could exist as a red car and even if I don&#8217;t change the color, still it could be red.</p>

<p>Pencil is whole, but I could break it (contingent property).</p>

<p><strong>Fire</strong> and being hot, fire is hot, that&#8217;s property, it isn&#8217;t contingent property, it IS <em>essential property</em>!</p>

<p>Plato says &#8221;<strong>Here is an essential property for the soul. Wherever there&#8217;s a soul it&#8217;s alive (it&#8217;s thinking, something capable of thought).</strong>&#8221;</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Life is an essential property of the soul.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soul is deathless.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>_Anything that&#8217;s deathless - cannot die, indestructible.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soul cannot be destroyed.</strong></p></li>
</ol>


<p>What does it mean to say that something is <strong>deathless</strong>?</p>

<ul>
<li>it can&#8217;t be that <strong>soul exists AND dead</strong></li>
<li>it can&#8217;t be that <strong>soul was destroyed</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>If life is an essential property of the soul, then that means we will never have soul in our hand and is dead.</p>

<p>How do you go about proving what something doesn&#8217;t exist? When do you need to prove that something doesn&#8217;t exist?
Example with dragons, how do I prove that there aren&#8217;t any dragons? Debunk about dragons and unicorns, you don&#8217;t need to check all caves around the world to say &#8220;no dragons here, no dragons in there&#8221;, <em>you are pretty much justified in being skeptical about the existence of dragons once you&#8217;ve undermined the arguments for dragons.</em></p>

<h1>Justice, Lecture 18. Aristotle: Justice and virtue</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>race and ethnice should count as a way of correcting for the true meaning of test scores and grades.</p></li>
<li><p>compensatory arguments, the idea of righting past wrongs, past injustice.</p></li>
<li><p>diversity argument. social mission, the common good (texas law school example).</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Can the university define its social purpose any way it wants to and then define admissions criteria accordingly?</strong></p>

<p>Justice is not a matter of rewarding or honoring virtue or honoring moral desert. Somehow they think tying justice to moral merit or virtue is going to lead away from freedom, from respect for persons as free beings.</p>

<p><strong>Aristotle</strong> explicitly ties justice to honor, honoring virtue and merit and moral desert.</p>

<p>For <strong>Aristotle, justice is</strong> a matter of giving people what they deserve, giving people their due. It&#8217;s a matter of figuring our the proper fir between persons with their virtues and their appropriate social roles.</p>

<p>Justice means giving each person his or her due, giving people what they deserve. <strong>But what is a person&#8217;s due?</strong>
Aristotle says that depends on the sort of things being distributed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Justice involves two factors: <strong>things</strong> and the <strong>persons</strong> to whom the things are assigned. In general we say that persons who are equal should have equal things assigned to them. Aristotle</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Equals in what respect?</strong> That depends on the sort of thing we are distributing. Example with <strong>flutes</strong> and it&#8217;s distributing. What is the relevant merit or basis of desert for flutes? Who should get the best ones? Artistotle answers was - the best flute players. All justice involves districimination, he says, what matters is that the distrimination be according to the relevant excellence, according to the virtue appropriate to having flutes. He says, it would be unjust to discriminte on some other basis in giving our the flutes.</p>

<p><strong>Why should best fluet goes to the best fluet player?</strong> Because that&#8217;s fluets are for, to be played well.</p>

<p><strong>TELOS - the point, the end, the goal</strong></p>

<p><strong>TELEOLOGICAL REASONING - Reasoning from the &#8220;telos&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><em>Reasoning from the purpose or from the telos or from the end.</em> Aristotle says that&#8217;s indispensable to thinking about justice.</p>

<hr />

<p>sovereign - суверенный, независимый
essential - существенный, основной, неотъемлемость
contingent - контингент, случай, условный, случайны
burden - бремя, нагрузка, груз
virtue - добродетель, сила, достоинство
indispensable - незаменимый, необходимый</p>

<li>Justice 16 about Distributive Justice: Who deserves what?</li>
<li>Mobile malware</li>
<li>Death Lecture 9 about Immortality of Soul</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h1>Justice</h1>

<p>Tree differenet theory of distributed justice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Libertarian system of distribution is a system of free exchange, a free market economy</strong> against a background of formal equality, which simply means that jobs and careers are open to anyone. Carees open for talents. But still resulsts is not going to be fait, it will be biased in favor of those who happened to be born to affluent families, who happen to have the benegit of good educational opportunities. <em>And that accident of birth is not a just basis for distributing life chances.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meritocractic - fair equality of opportunity</strong>. The fastest runner will win.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Egalitarian (Democratic conception) - Rawls difference principle.</strong> People may gain, may benefit from their good fortune but only on terms that work to the advantage of the least well-off.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Objections to difference principle:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What about incentives (стимул)? Isn&#8217;t there the risk if taxes reach 70%, 80%, 90% marginal rate that Michael Jordan won&#8217;t play basketball, or CEO.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>The natural advantaged are not to gain merely because they are more gifted, but only to cover the costs of training and education and for using their endowments (пожертвования) in ways that help the less fortunate as well. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>What about effort? What about people working hard, having a right to what they earn because they deserved it? They&#8217;ve worked hard for it.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Life is not fair. It is tempting to believe that government can rectify (исправлять) what nature has spawned. Milton Friedman (book Free to Choose)</p>

<p>The natural distribution is neither just nor unjust; nor is it unjust that persons are born into society at some particular position. These are simply natural facts. What is just and unjust is the way that institutions deal with these facts. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>What about self-ownership?</li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe we don&#8217;t own ourselves in that thoroughgoing (радикальный) sense after all. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the state is an owner in me in the sence that it can simply commandeer my life, because remember the first principle we would agree to behind the veil of ignorance is <em>the principle of equal basic liberties (freedom of speech, religious liberty, freedom of conscience and the like)</em>. I own myself in the sense that I have a privileged claim on the benefits that come from the exercise of my talents in a market economy, and Rawls says on reflection, we don&#8217;t! We can defend right, we can respect the individual without embracing the idea of self-possession.</p>

<p>Example about constructors Big vs Small. Big can build wall in couple hours when Small could do same thing in couple days. Meritocracy says Big deserves to make more. It isn&#8217;t really effort, contributions matters.</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between moral deserts and entitlement?</strong></p>

<p>Consider two different games, a game of chance and a game of skill. Take a <em>game of pure chance</em> - just a game of luck, no sense in which I morally deserve to win in the first place. Ok, then let&#8217;s see <em>game of skill</em>, 49 vs raiders - it can be always asked of a game of skill, did the deserve to win?</p>

<p>Rawls says distributive justice is not a matter of moral desert, though, it is a matter of entitlements to legitimate expectations:</p>

<blockquote><p>A just scheme answers to what men are entitled to; it satisfies their legitimate expectations as founded upon social institutions. But what they are entitled to is not proportional to or dependent upon their intrinsic worth. John Rawls</p>

<p>The principles of justice that regulate the basic structure&#8230; do not mention moral desert, and there is no tendency for distributive shares to correspond to it.</p></blockquote>

<p>My talants reap in a market economy, what does it depend on? What other people happen to want or like in this society, it depends on the law of supply and demand. That&#8217;s not my doing, what counts as contributing depends on the qualities that this or that society happens to prize. <em>In a capitalist society it helps to have entepreneurial drive.</em></p>

<p>We are antitled to the benefits that the rules of the game promise for the exercises of our talents.But it&#8217;s a mistake and conceit (тщаславие, самомнение) to suppose that we deserve in the first place a society that values the qualities we happen to have in abundance (изобилии)</p>

<hr />

<h1>Quiz 4</h1>

<h2>1. What is the original position?</h2>

<p>A hypothetical scenario in which people who are temporarily placed behind a veil of ignorance that covers up their knowledge about who in particular they are ( e.g. their social status and natural talents) choose the principles of justice for their society.</p>

<h2>2. What is the main function of the veil of ignorance?</h2>

<p>To ensure that people are not biased by knowledge about particular facts about themselves (e.g. how strong or intelligent they are) when thinking about matters of justice.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why, according to Rawls, is a hypothetical contract between people of equal standing who are placed behind a veil of ignorance morally more significant than an actual contract?</li>
</ol>


<p>Because it is not tainted by assymetries in bargaining power (e.g. differences in people&#8217;s wealth or intelligence or strength)</p>

<ol>
<li>Individuals who use their talents to earn an income on the free market sometimes claim that they ought to be allowed to keep all of that income because they morally deserve it. How would Rawls respond to this?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>The fact that you were born with the talents you have is a morally arbitrary fact. You do not morally deserve your talents, and so the claim that you deserve the wealth that your talents attract is dubious.</p>

<p>The fact that you were born in a society in which your particular talents are in high demand or in low supply is a morally arbitrary fact. The fact that your particular talents are in high demand or in low supply is what allows you to use those talents to become wealthy. So the claim that you deserve the wealth that your talents attract is dubious.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Rawls think that people are justified in owning the objects and wealth that they do when:</li>
</ol>


<p>The objects and wealth were acquired withint a market regulated by principles of justice that protect individual liberties and fair equality of opportunity for all and then work to the benefit of the least well-off members of society.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Lecture 9 - Plato, Part IV: Arguments for the Immortality of the Soul</strong></p>

<p>Idestructible mean immortal. What is to be for some things being indestructible?</p>

<p>Changing is a matter of the rearrangment of the parts. If something can change it is not simple.</p>

<p><strong>Sould does indeed change</strong>. One day you believe, for example, that it&#8217;s hot, next day it&#8217;s cold. Desire to learn piano and then give up about it.</p>

<p>Soul is simple? In Republic Plato argues that <strong>soul not simple at all</strong> (three parts, rational, spirited, appetite).</p>

<p>Simple can&#8217;t destroy, because they don&#8217;t have parts and you can&#8217;t take them apart. But what about if just <em>goes our of existence</em></p>

<p>Haromny of the harp, like mind to the body. Harmony is something that gets produced by a well-tuned instrument, the soul or the mind is something that gets produced by well-tunned body.</p>

<h1>Plato says:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Harmony crearly cannot exist before the existence of the harp itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Harmony can vary (melodiosly of harp). The mental aspect can come in degree, intelligence, creativity, reasonbless and like.</p></li>
<li><p>Soul can be good or it can be evil. Harmonious soul? Looks strange, but we say mind/soul is like the harmony.</p></li>
<li><p>Soul is capable to directing your body. Your soul can opposed your body. Function of the body can wiggle my finger, my mind give instruction my body (my brain give instruction to other part of my body - fingers). As melody can affect the harp.</p></li>

<h1>Defining Obesity</h1>

<ul>
<li>82% increase in global obesity X 20 years</li>
<li>middle east 100% increase since 1990</li>
<li>2008: > 1.4 billion adults, age 20+ overweight</li>
<li>200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese</li>
<li>65% global population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweigth</li>
<li>more than 40 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2010</li>
</ul>


<p>Louis Dublin:</p>

<ul>
<li>small, medium, large</li>
<li>20-25% > desirable wt for frame</li>
<li>70-100% > desirable wt for frame</li>
</ul>


<p>Adolphe Quetelet create quetelet index (1832), weight increases as the square of the height</p>

<p>Dr. Ancel Keys confirmed validity of Quetelet index and coined the term &#8220;BMI&#8221; in 1972.</p>

<p>BMI - kg/m2 or (lb/in2) * 703:</p>

<ul>
<li>underweight &lt; 18.5</li>
<li>normal weight 18.5 - 24.9</li>
<li>overweight 25.0 - 29.9</li>
<li>obese > 30</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additional Measurements:</h2>

<ul>
<li>waist circumference</li>
<li>waist-to-hip ratio</li>
<li>skinfold thickness</li>
<li>percent body fat (bioelectrical impedance, underwater weighung, DEXA)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Causes of Obesity</h2>

<ul>
<li>increased intake of energy-dense food that are high in fat, salt and sugar but low in vitamins and minerals</li>
<li>decrease in physical activity</li>
</ul>


<h1>2. Energy Balance</h1>

<p><em>Intake</em> (calories from food) and <em>Output</em> (calories used to maintain body function and physical activity)</p>

<p>Intake:</p>

<ul>
<li>protein</li>
<li>fat</li>
<li>carbohydrates</li>
<li>alcohol</li>
</ul>


<p>Output:</p>

<ul>
<li>basal metabolism (burning just sitting)</li>
<li>thermic effect of food (burning to process)</li>
<li>physical activity (15-30% of total energy expenditure, walking, yard work)</li>
<li>thermogenesis (sleeping, eating, sports-like exercise)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Storage of Excess Calories:</h2>

<ul>
<li>excess carbohydrate stores as fat</li>
<li>excess protein stores as fat</li>
<li>excess fat stores as fat (converted and stores as fat)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Metabolic fitness</h2>

<ul>
<li>central obesity</li>
<li>triglyceride levels</li>
<li>HDL</li>
<li>blood pressure</li>
<li>fasting blood glucose</li>
</ul>


<h1>3. Metabolic syndrome</h1>

<p>Claster of risk factors. Heart deasis, stroke, diabet.</p>

<p>Criteria for Metabolic Syndrome(at least 3 of those 5):</p>

<ul>
<li>waist circumference (males > 40 inches, females 35 inches)</li>
<li>high blood pressure > 130/85 mm Hg</li>
<li>fasting blood sugar > 110 mm Hg</li>
<li>triglycerides > 150 mm Hg</li>
<li>HDL males &lt; 40 mg/dL, females &lt; 50 mg/dL</li>
</ul>


<p>Apple-shaped fat patterning (more dangerious) and Pear-shaped fat patterning.</p>

<p>Metabolic syndrome doubled the risk of heart attack in both men and women.</p>

<h1>4. Pediatric Obesity</h1>

<p>1:6 US children obese; 1:3 are overweigh or obese</p>

<p>6-11 year old:</p>

<ul>
<li>1980 7%</li>
<li>2008 20% (tripled)</li>
</ul>


<p>12-19 year old:</p>

<ul>
<li>1980 5%</li>
<li>2008 18%</li>
</ul>


<p>43 millions preschool in 2010 (35 million of these are in development country). As countries wealth increases traditional diet towards a more westernized diet.</p>

<ul>
<li>increase diabetes 2</li>

<h1>Justice </h1>

<p>Kant says that laws arise from a vertain kind of social contract. But this contract is of an exceptional nature. He points out that <em>the contract that generates justice</em> is what he calls an <em>idea of reason</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A contract that generates principles of right is merely an idea of reason, but it has undoubted practical reality, because it can oblige (обязывать) every legislator to frame his laws in such a way that they could have been produced by the united will of the whole nation. Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>What is the moral force of a hypthetical contract, a contract that never happened?</strong></p>

<p>John Rawls who worked out in his book a detail an acouunt of a hypothetical agreement as the basis for justice. Like Kant, Rawls was a critic of utilitarianism:</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote><p>Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override&#8230; The rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining (переговоры) or to the calculus of social interests. John Rawls</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Principles of justice, properly undersood, can be derived from hypothetical social contract, not an actual one. (Veil (вуаль) of ignorance).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The way to arrive at the basic right that we must respect, the basic framework of rights and duties is to imagine that we were gathered together trying to choose the principles to govern our collective lives without knowing cerain important particular facts about ourselves. - <strong>That&#8217;s the idea of veil of ignorance</strong></p>

<p>Veil of ignorance abstracts us from or brackets, hides from us, who in particular we are, our race, class, place in society, we&#8217;re healthy or unhealthy. Then we would agree to we come up to principles of justice. <strong>That&#8217;s how the hypothetical contract works</strong></p>

<p>What is the moral force of this kind of hypothetical agreement? Is it stronger or weaker than actual social contract?</p>

<h1>Moral force of actual contracts:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>how do they bind or obligate me?</p></li>
<li><p>consent-based as a voluntary act and it points to the ideal of <strong>autonomy</strong>. <em>When I make a contract, the obligation is one that is self-imposed and that carries a certain moral weight independent of other considerations</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>benefit-based and this points toward the ideal of <strong>reciprocity</strong> (взаимность). <em>I can have an obligation to you insofar as you do something for me</em></p></li>
<li><p>how do actual real life contracts justife the terms they produce? they dont! at least not on their own. the fact of the agreement never garuantees the fairness of the agreement. (Constitution about persisting slaver - it was an actual contract, but that doesn&#8217;t establish that the laws agreed to, all of them, were just)</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Example</h1>

<p>We made an agreement, a commercial agreement. I promise to pay you 100$ if you will go harvest and bring to me 100 lobsters. You go our and bring them to me, I eat the lobsters, serve them to my friends and then I don&#8217;t pay. And you say, but you&#8217;re obligated! I say - why? Well, we had a deal and you benefited, you ate all those lobsters. I benefited from your labor - very strong argument.</p>

<p>Second case, then we made the agreement and in two minutes I called and say I&#8217;ve changed my mind. No benifits, no lobsters, no work you part, there is no element of reciprocal exchange. Do I still owe you?</p>

<p>paternalism (отеческое попечение)</p>

<p>A contract or an act of consent is not only not sufficient, but it&#8217;s not even a necessary condition of there being an obligation.</p>

<p><strong>David Hume</strong></p>

<p>When he was young, Hume wrote a book arguing against Locke&#8217;s idea of an original social contract. He said, &#8220;It was a philosophical fiction, one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible (непонятный) operations that can possibly be imagined&#8221;. And then when he was 62 he got an example of it:</p>

<p>house -> his friend rented it -> sub-lent it to third person and this person signed a contract with painter to paint the house and send the bill to Hume (he refused to pay). In court he said he didn&#8217;t sign any contract, that was true. Defance failed and he had to pay.</p>

<p><strong>The main idea - actual contracts have their moral force in virtue of two distinguishable ideals, autonomy and reciprocity</strong> <em>But in real life, every actual contract may fall short, may fail to realize the ideal that give contracts their moral force in the first place.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Justice Lecture 15</p>

<p>How should income and wealth and power and opportunities be distributed?</p>

<p>Why Rawls think that principles of justice are best derived from a hyphotetical contract? <em>Hyphotetical contract be carried out in an original position of equality (the veil of ignorance)</em></p>

<p>Principles choosen behind the veil of ignorance.
Fundamental right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly (свобода собраний), religious:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Utilitarism makes a mistake because forgetting it&#8217;s not taking seriosly the distinction between persons. We wouldn&#8217;t trade off our fundamental right and liberties for any economic advantages.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#8217;s require an equal deistribution income and wealth, but we could do better if we agree to qualified principle of equality (Rawls calls it the difference principle). A principle that says only those social and economic inequalities will be permited that work to the benefit of the least well off (в интересах наименее обеспеченных). Test would be <strong>do they work to the benefit of everyone, including those, especially those at the bottom.</strong></p></li>
</ol>


<p>The distribution of income and wealth and opportunities should not be based on factors for which people can clainm no credit, it shouldn&#8217;t be based on factors that are arbitrary from a moral point of view.</p>

<p><strong>Feudal aristocracy</strong>. What&#8217;s wrong? Rawls says, the thing that&#8217;s obviosly wrong about it is that people&#8217;s life prospects are determined by the accident of birth, you can&#8217;t rise, it&#8217;s not your doing where you wind up or what opportunities you have.</p>

<p><strong>Libertarian system</strong>. What&#8217;s wrong? Rawls says, it&#8217;s an improment because it doesn&#8217;t take as fixed the accident of birth. And even so, if you let everybody run the race, everybody can enter the race, but some people start at different starting points, that race isn&#8217;t going to be fair.</p>

<p>Merit based system, a <strong>meritrocratic system</strong>. Everyone regardless of their family background, has a genuinely fair opportunity. Everyone starts from the same starting line. Rawls thinks even that, doesn&#8217;t go far enough in remedying (устранение) or addressing the moral arbitrariness of the natural lottery. Because if your bring everyone at the same starting point and begin the race, who&#8217;s going to win the race? The fastest runner would win, but is it their doing that they happen to be blessed with the athletic prowess to run fast? So, even the principle of <strong>meritocracy</strong>, where you bring everyone to the same starting point, may eliminate the influence of social contingencies and upbringing, <em>but it still permits the distribution of wealth and icome to be determined by the natural distribution of abilities and talents</em>.</p>

<p>People may benefit from their good fortune, from their luck in the genetic lottery, but only on terms that work to the advantage of the least well off.</p>

<p>Example: Michael Jordan can make $31 million, but only under a system that taxes away a chunk of that to help those who lack the basketball skills that he&#8217;s blessed with.</p>

<p>Bill Gates, but he can&#8217;t think he somehow morally deserves those billions.</p>

<blockquote><p>Those who have been favored by nature, whoever they are, may gain from their good fortune only on terms that improve the situation of those who have lost our. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<h1>Justice: Immanuel Kant: A lesson in lying</h1>

<p>Kant believes that if we choose freely, out of our own consciences (совесть), the moral law, we&#8217;re guaranteed to come up with one and <em>same moral law</em>.</p>

<p>How is a categorical imperative possible? How is morality possible?</p>

<p>two distinctives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>as an object of experience, I belong to the sensible world there my actions are determined by the laws of nature and by the regularities of causes and effect.</p></li>
<li><p>When we think of ourselves as free we transfer ourselves into the intelligible world as members and recognize the autonomy of the will.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Only because <em>the idea of freedom</em> makes me a member of an intelligible world.</p>

<p>Because of realm of freedom and realm of necessity - there is always potentially a gap between <em>what we do and what we ought to do</em>.</p>

<p>No science could deliver moral truth.</p>

<p>Case about murderer at the door, looking for your friend who was hiding in your house and the mureder ask you &#8220;is your friend in your house?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Kant says it&#8217;s wrong to lie even to the murderer at your door. But misleading truth pays a certain homage (дань) to duty.</p>

<ul>
<li>plausible (правдоподобный)</li>
</ul>


<h1>QUIZ 3</h1>

<ol>
<li>Which of the following best captures Kant&#8217;s Formula of Humanity as End?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in any other person, always at the same time as an end, never merely as means.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>I am to make a deceitful (лживый) promise in circumstances in which my situation is such that I am in real need of money and I know I will never be able to pay it back in orider to further my own personal advantage. Kant claims that the universalization of this maxi, results in a contradiction. What does Kant mean?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Kant means thet we cannot imagine a world where everyone makes deveitful promises, because the practice of promising presupposes trust and no one would trust anyone in a world where everyone makes deceitful promises.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>In Kant&#8217;s time, peasants would sometimes sell their teeth to wealthier individuals who needed them. Kant objected to this, and he would presumably, for similar reasons, object to selling orgrans (like kidneys) in the present day. Which of following most accurate characterizes Kant&#8217;s reasons for objecting to selling part of one&#8217;s body?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>By selling part of her body, a person would be treating herself as a mere means, and not as an end in herself.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Which of the following most accurately expresses Kant&#8217;s view about the relationship between freedom and duty?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>To be truly free, a person must not act on laws that are imposed on her by another, but only on laws that she gives to herself. The moral law is the law that a rational being gives to herself. Therefore, the person who acts from the moral law is tryly free.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Kant offers an example of an honest shopkeeper who refuses to cheat his customers. Kant imagines one motive that the shopkeerper might have: a worry that if he is dishonest, word will get our and he will love business. Why does Kant discuss this example?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>He want to demonstrate that an honest action can sometimes lack moral worth if it is done from the wrong motive.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Про лгущего самому себе человек</h2>

<blockquote><p>Лгущий себе самому прежде всех и обидеться может. Ведь обидеться иногда очень приятно, не так ли? И ведь знает человек, что никто не обидел его, а что он сам себе обиду навыдумал и налгал для красы, сам преувеличил, чтобы картину создать, к слову привязался и из горошины сделал гору, - знает это, а все-таки самый первый обижается до приятности, до ощущения большого удовольствия, а тем самым доходит и до вражды истинной&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8230;накрыл <em>эпитрахилью</em>&#8230; - принадлежность богослужебного облачения православного священника и епископа, длинная лента, огибающая шею и обоими концами спускающаяся на грудь.</p>

<h2>Про Ивана Карамазова</h2>

<p>Ум его в плену. В нем мысль великая и неразрешимая. Он их тех, которым не надо миллионов, а надобно мысль разрешить.</p>

<blockquote><p>А Россия свинство. Друг мой, если бы ты знал, как я ненавижу Россию&#8230; то есть не Россиию, а все эти пороки&#8230; а пожалуй что и Россию. Tout cela c&#8217;est de la cochonnerie (все это свинство). Знаешь, что я люблю? Я люблю остроумие. Отец Федор Павлович Карамазов</p>

<p>Впрочем, к тридцати годам, наверное, брошу кубок, хоть и не допью всего и отойду&#8230; не знаю куда. Но до тридцати моих лет, знаю это твердо, все победит моя молодость - всякое разочарование, всякое отвращение к жизни. Иван</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Нет заботы беспрерывнее и мучительнее для человека, как, оставишись свободным, сыскать себе поскорее того, пред кем преклонить.</em></p>

<p><em>Ибо тайна бытия человеческого не в том, чтобы только жить, а в том, для чего жить. Без твердого представления себе, для чего ему жить, человек не согласиться жить и скорей истребит себя, чем останется на змеле, хотя бы кругом его все были хлебы.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>Ибо привык надеяться на себя одного и от целого отделился единицей, приучил свою душу не верить в людскую помощь, в людей и в человечество, и только и трепещет того, что пропадут его деньги и приобретенные им права его. Повсеместно ныне ум человеческий начинает насмешливо не понимать, что истинное обеспечение лица состоит не в личном уединенном его усилии, а в людской общей целостности. Копит уединенно богатство и думает: сколь силен я теперь и сколь обеспечен, а и не знает безумный, что чем более копит, тем более погружается в самоубийственное бессилие.</p></blockquote>

<p>Все действия проходили в Скотопригоньевске.</p>

<h2>Про синапсисы</h2>

<p>Вообрази себе: это там в нервых, в голове, то есть там в мозгу эти нервы (ну черт их возьми!)&#8230; есть такие этакие хвостики, у нервов этих хвостики, ну, и как только они там задрожат&#8230; то есть видишь, я посмотрю на что-нибудь глазами, вот так, и они задрожат, хвостики-то&#8230; а как задрожат, то и является образ, и не сейчас является, а там какое-то мгновение, секунда такая пройдет, и является такой будто бы момент, то есть не момент, - черт его дери момент, - а образ, то есть предмет али происшествие, ну там черт дери - вот почему я созерцаю, а потом мыслю&#8230; потому что хвостики, а вовсе не потому, что у меня душа и что я там какой-то образ и подобие, все это глупости. Великолепна, Алеша, эта наука! Новый человек пойдет, это-то я понимаю&#8230; А все-таки Бога жалко!</p>

<h1>Alain de Botton about Pessimism <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Aw1oLtuJOXQ">video</a></h1>

<p>Seneca, pessimism isn&#8217;t bad.</p>

<p><em>Meritocracy</em> - conceptualizes merit in terms of tested competency and ability, and most likely, as measured by IQ or standardized achievement tests. Very many options to make meritocracy, many inputs and outputs.</p>

<blockquote><p>A man must swallow a toad every morning to make sure he doesn&#8217;t run into anything more disgusting the rest of the day.</p></blockquote>

<p>We believe in the future and very optimistic about it. Rates of suiced growths because of failure.</p>

<p>Now &#8220;work&#8221; assumed with happines. Before it was slavery. Now you should marry because of love (crazy idea), before you should marry someone to handle bussines/property.</p>

<p>Happily sad (pessimism) - scull on the table, readjust our priority, what people think about you, about carrier - doesn&#8217;t matter at all because of death. Find the artist that says not like &#8220;life is cheriful&#8221;, like philosopher Shopenhaur, Pascal, list Elton John (sad songs).</p>

<p>Sad and sadness can improve your sexopile, sadness can brings you dates.</p>

<p>Leaving sadness the full, darknes, read some Nietzsche</p>

<blockquote><p>To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities - I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not - that one endures. <strong>Nietzsche</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>We want to many things
We give to quickly, because we are addicted to comfortabless. And christianity allows to be weak.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals</h1>

<p>Rational knowledge:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>material</em> - deteminate objects and laws to which they are subject.</li>
<li><em>formal</em> - universal laws of thought in general without distinction of its objects. <strong>Logic</strong>. Logic can&#8217;t have any empirical part.</li>
</ul>


<p>We must begin with pure philosophy (metaphysic), and without it there cannot be any moral philosphy at all.</p>

<p><em>empirical</em> means based on, concerned with or verifiable by observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic.</p>

<p>We may call all philosophy empirical, so far as it is based on grounds of experience: on the other hand, that which deliviers its doctrines from a priori principles alone we may call pure philosophy. If it&#8217;s merely <em>formal</em> it is <em>logic</em>; if it is restricted to definite objects of the understanding - <em>metaphysic</em>.</p>

<p>For the metaphysic of morals has to examine the idea and the principles of a possible <em>pure will</em>, and <em>not the acts and conditions of human volition</em> generally, which for the most part are drawn from <em>psychology</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Justice: The supreme principle of morality</h1>

<p>When reason governs our will, we are not driven by the desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Our capacity for reason is bound up with our capacity for freedom. Taken together, these capacities make us distincive, and set us apart from mere animal existence. They make us more than mere creatures of appetite.</p>

<p>Whenever my behavior is biologically determined of socially conditioned, it is not truly free. To act freely, according to Kant, is to act autonomously. And to act autonomously is to act according to a law I give myself - not according to the dictates of nature or social convention.</p>

<h2>What is the supreme (высший) principle of morality? </h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>MORALITY</strong> motive according to which we act. the motive of duty, doing the right thing for the right reason. For an action to have moral worth it <em>must be done for the sake of duty not out of inclination</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>FREEDOM</strong> determination of will. desire to persue some interest. Two different ways that my <em>will</em> can be determined:</p></li>
<li><p>autonomously (according to Kant I&#8217;m only free when it determened autonomously which means it&#8217;s <em>according to a law that I give myself</em>. Where the law come from (a law that we give ourselves)? <em>Reason</em>, if reason determines my will then the real becomes to power to choose independent of the dictates of nature or inclination or circumstance)</p></li>
<li><p>heteronously</p></li>
<li><p><strong>REASON</strong> Imperatives</p></li>
<li><p>hypothetical imperatives use instrimental reason (if you want X then do y. <em>It means ends reason</em>, example <em>if you want a good business reputation then don&#8217;t shortchange your customers</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>categorical withour reference to or dependents on any further purpose</p></li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>If the action would be good solely as a means to something else, the imperative is hypothetical; if the action is represented as good in itself and therefore as necessary&#8230; for a will wchi of itself accords with reason, then the imperative is categorical. Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote>

<h1>The categorical imperative</h1>

<ol>
<li><p><em>The Formula of Univesal Law</em>. Act only on that maxim (the rule that explain the reason that you are doing, a principle, for example <em>promise keeping</em>) whereby you can at the same time will that is should become a universal law.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Formula of Humanity as End</em>. We can&#8217;t base the categorical imperative on any particular interests, purposes, or ends because then it would be only relative to the person whose ends they were, but suppose there were something whose existence has in itself an absolute value&#8230; an end in itself&#8230; then in it, and in it alone, would there be the ground of a possible categorical imperative.
I say that man, and in general every rational being, exists as an end in himself, not merely as a means for arbitraty use by this or that will.</p></li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time, as an end. Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote>

<p>Example: When I make a false promise to you, I mean using you as a means to my ends, to my desire for the hundred dollars and so I&#8217;m failing to respect you, your dignity, I&#8217;m manipulating you</p>

<p>Example with murder and suicide: they are odds with <em>categorical imperative</em>. Why? If I murder someone, I&#8217;m taking their life for some purpose (maybe I&#8217;m hires killer or I&#8217;m in the throws of some great anger or passion) as a means, so murder violate categorical imperative. With suicide we failing to respect humanity as and end, so I violate that dignity in my own person if I commit suicide and in murder if I take somebody else&#8217;s life from a moral point of view.</p>

<p>Kantian respect is unlike love in this way, it&#8217;s unlike sympathy, because love and other thing have to do with who they are in particular, but <strong><em>respect</em> for Kant is respect for humanity which is universal</strong>.</p>

<h2>Mispeller </h2>

<p>It&#8217;s fine to have sentiments and feelings that support doing the right thing, they don&#8217;t provide the reason for acting.</p>

<p>How is freedom possible?</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Natural&#8221;</em> means nothing. Botanical products are from plants - but plants contain many chemicals and compounds. Sugar is used by all cells in the body for energy, nothing wrong with it (&#8220;sugar feeds cancer&#8221; wrong). <em>Milk</em> and low amount of <em>calcium</em> (200 mg/day) may protect against breast cancer, at levels > <em>1500 mg/day</em> may possibly <em>increase</em> prostate cancer risk.</p>

<p><em>Microwaving</em> food in plastic wrap cause cancer? There are no dioxins in plastic. Phthalates not commonly used in plastic wraps in the US. Follow manufacturer recommendations: avoid food contact with wrap if microwaving.</p>

<p><strong>Justice</strong></p>

<h2>Immanuel Kant</h2>

<p>Not to use people as means even for good ends. Difficult thinker. The book is about what the supreme principle of morality is and it&#8217;s also gives us an account one of the most powerful accounts we have of what <em>freedom</em> really is.</p>

<p>Kant rejected utilitarism. He thinks that every human beings have a certain dignity (достоинство) that commands our respect. The resaon the individual is sacred or the bearer of right according to Kant, doesn&#8217;t stem from the idea that we own ourselves, but instead from the idea that we are all <em>ratinal beings</em>. Which means we are beings <em>who are capable of reason</em>. We also <em>autonomous beings</em> which is to say that we are beings capable of acting and choosing <em>freely</em>.</p>

<p>Kant admints the utilitarians were half right, we seek to avoid pain and we like plreasure. He does deny is <em>Bentham&#8217;s</em> clain that <strong>pain and pleasure are our sovereign (верховный) masters</strong>. Kant thinks that&#8217;s wrong, it&#8217;s rational capacity that makes us distinctive, that makes us special, that <em>set us apart from and above mere animal existence</em>. It makes us something more than just physical creatures with appetites.</p>

<h2>Kant about freedom</h2>

<p>When we like animals seek after pleasure or the satisfaction of our desires of the avoidance pain when we do that we arean&#8217;t really acting freely. We realy acting as the slaves of those appetites and impulses.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t choose this particular hunger or that particular appetite, and so when I act to satisfy it I&#8217;m just acting accorind to natural necessity and for Kant <em>freedom is opposite of necessity</em>.</p>

<p>obey your thirst - example with Sprite slogan. You think you choosing freely Sprite or Pepsi, but you&#8217;re actually obeying something, a thirst, or maybe a desire manufactured or messaged by advertising.</p>

<p>How can my will be detemined if not by prompting subnature or my hunger or my appetite or my desires? <em>Kant&#8217;s conception of freedom</em></p>

<p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>to act freely is to act autonomously = is to act according to a law that I give myself. (not according to the physical laws of nature or to the laws of cause and effect which include <em>my desire, to eat or to drink or to choose this food in a restaurant over that</em>)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Heteronomy</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>when I act heteronomously I&#8217;m acting according to an inclination (наклонность, склон, предрасположение) or a desire that I haven&#8217;t chosen for myself.</p></blockquote>

<p>To act <em>freely</em> is not to choose the best means to a given end - it&#8217;s to choose the end itself for its own sake. (here is example with bilard ball which according to the law of nature/law of gravity will drop on the floor and can only follow this rules, when himan being can do - choose the end itself).</p>

<p>We act as means to the realization of ends given outside us, we are instruments rather than authors of the purposes we pursue. (<em>heteronomy</em>)</p>

<p>When we act as autonomus we cease to be instruments to purposes given outside us, we become or we can come to think of ourselves as ends in ourselves. (it gives humans special dignity)</p>

<p><em>respecting human dignity</em> means regarding persons not just as means but also as end themselves (this is why it&#8217;s wrong to use people for the sake of other people well being of happiness). (this is why Kant thinks utilitarianism goes wrong, it&#8217;s important to respect the dignity of persons and to uphold (поддерживать) their rights). Freedom as autonomy.</p>

<p>What gives an action it&#8217;s moral worth? What makes an action morally worthy consists not in the conseqiences or in the results that flow from it - morally worthy has to do with the motive with the quality of the will with the intention for which the act is down and the motive must be of a certain kind.</p>

<p><strong>Kant&#8217;s conception of morality</strong></p>

<p>Moral worth of an action depens of motive (do the right thing for the right reason)</p>

<blockquote><p>A good will isn&#8217;t good because of what effects or accomplishes, it&#8217;s good in itself. Even if by utmost (все возможное) effort the good will accomplishes nothing it would still shine like a jewel for its own sake as something which has its full value in itself. Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Duty (moral worth an action is the motive of duty) <strong>VS</strong> Inclination (desires)</em></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Shopkeeper and inexperienced customer comes in, shopkepeer know that he could give the customer the wrong change. But reputation would be damaged and I would lose business, so I won&#8217;t shortchange this customer. Shopkepeer does nothing wrong, he gives a correct change, but <em>does this action have moral worth?</em> Kant says NO, because shopkepeer did it with wrong motive - out of self-interest.</p>

<p>Suicide.</p>

<p>Better bussines bureau - honest is the best policy, it&#8217;s also the most profitable.</p>

<p><em>Soy food</em> do not increase any cancer risk, may even help lower risk (not proven). General guidelines are to avoid soy supplements.</p>

<p><em>Fiber</em> 5% reduction in breast cancer for each additional 10 grams fiber per day consumed. Inverse association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk.</p>

<p><em>Calcium</em> recommended dose 1500 mg calcium, 400-800 IU vitamin D per day.</p>

<p><strong>Justice</strong></p>

<p>Egg donor from a woman who was intelenget, athletic, 5&#8221;10&#8217;, 1400 SAT. $50k</p>

<p>Sperm - $70.</p>

<p><em>Egg or sperm should or not to sold for money?</em></p>

<p>Mrs. Stern met Mary 29, surrogate mother. They&#8217;ve made a deal, 10k$ in exchange AI with Stern sperm and give the baby to the Sterns.</p>

<p>Objections to enforcing surrogacy contracts:
- tainted (испорчен, запятнан) constent 1) coercion 2) lack of information.
- dehumanizing</p>

<p>Court said the contract is enforceable. NJ supremecourt said ths contract is uneforceable:</p>

<p>Under the contract the natural motther is irrevocably committed before she know the strength of her bond with her child. She never makes a truly voluntary, informed decision, for any decision prior to the baby&#8217;s birth is, in the most important sense, uninformed.</p>

<p>This is the sale of a child, or, the very least, the sale of a mother&#8217;s right to her child&#8230; Whatever idealism may motivate the participants, the profit motive predomintates, permeates, and ultimately governs the transaction.</p>

<p>Emotionals bond to the child.</p>

<p><strong>Mill&#8217;s Utilitarianism</strong></p>

<p>Respect people rights is a way of making everybody better of in the long run.</p>

<p>Strong theory of rights that says individual matter not just as instruments to be used for a larger social purpose or for the sake of maximazing utility, individuals are separate beings with separate lives worthy of respect.</p>

<p><em>Liberarianism</em> takes individual rights seriosly, because it say the fundemntal individual right is the right to liberty. Because we are separate humans we have individual right to libery, and that means the right to choose freely to live our lives as we please provided with respect other people&#8217;s rights.</p>

<blockquote><p>Inviduals have rights so strong and far-reaching are these rights that they raise the quiestion of what, if anything the state may do. Robert Nozick</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Libertarian view of goverment</h2>

<ol>
<li>No Paternalist Legislation (that&#8217;s passing laws that protect people from themselves, seatbelt for example)</li>
<li>No Morals Legislation (moral values of the society, gays and lesbians)</li>
<li>No Redistribution of income from rich to poor.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Nozick</strong>: What makes income distribution just?</p>

<ol>
<li>Justice in Acquisition (initial holdings, did people get the things they use to get their money fairly, ex. stole factory, land)</li>
<li>Justice in Transfer (free choice buying and selling things, free market)</li>
</ol>


<p>Nozick agrees that taxation is theft</p>

<p>Taxation = taking of earnings, in other words it means taking the fruits of my labor, but if the state has a right to take my earnings or the fruits of my labor.</p>

<p><em>Taking of earnings = forced labor.</em> Because forced labor involves in taking of my leisure, my time, my effors.</p>

<p><em>Forced labor = slavery</em></p>

<p><em>Violates Principle of Self-Possession</em></p>

<p>To coerce someone to use some person for the sake of the general welfare is wrong, bc it calls to the question of fundumental fact that we own ourselves <strong>self-possession or self ownership</strong>.</p>

<p>Objections to libertarianism:</p>

<ol>
<li>The poor need the money more</li>
<li>Taxation by consent of the governed is not coerced</li>
<li>The successfil owe a debt to society</li>
</ol>


<p>Liberitarians combat the utility idea of using people as means for the collective happiness by saying the way to put a stop to that utilitarian logic of using persons is to resort to the intuitively powerful idea that <em>we are the proprietors of our own person</em>.</p>

<p>Nozick borrows some idea from John Locke where he accounted for the rise of private property from the state of nature by a chain of reasoning very similar to the one that Nozick and the libertarians use. John Locke said private property arises because when we mix our labor with things unowned things we come to acquire a property right in those things.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>John Locke</strong></p>

<p>There are certain fundamental individual rights include a natural right to life libery and property and he argues that the right to property is not just a creation of goverment or law, <em>the law of property</em> is a natural rightin the sence it is pre-political, it&#8217;s a right that attaches to individuals as human beings. He says the state of nature is the state of liberty, human beings are free and equal beings, there is no natural hierarchy and yet there&#8217;s a difference between a state of libery and the state of licence.</p>

<p>Even I&#8217;m free, i&#8217;m not free to violate the law of nature, take my own life or to sell myself to slavery (You are the creature of God and God has a bigger property right in us).</p>

<blockquote><p>For men, being all the workmanship (мастерство) of one omnipotent (всемогущий), and infinitely wise maker (God), they are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one another&#8217;s pleasure. John Locke</p>

<p>Freedom can&#8217;t just be a matter of doing whatever we want. The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it which obliges everyone: and reason, which is that law, teches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possession (владение).</p></blockquote>

<p>Natural rights is inalienable (неотъемлемые). <strong>Inalienable</strong> it&#8217;s not for us to alienate(отчуждать) them or to get them up to give them a way to trade them the way, to sell them.</p>

<p><em>Airlines tickets are inalienable</em>, I own them in the limited sense that I can use them for myself, but I can&#8217;t trade them away.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has any right to but himself. The labor of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. John Locke</p>

<p>Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature has provided, and left it in, he has mixed his labor with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. John Locke</p>

<p>For this labor being the unqestionable property of the laborer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good left in common for others. John Locke</p>

<p>As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates and can use the product of, so much is his property. He by his labor does, as it were, enclose it from the common.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Quiz 2 (Justice)</h1>

<ol>
<li>According to Robert Nozick, the state is justified to tax a citizen (even against his or her will) if:</li>
</ol>


<p>The answer is <em>the taxes are used to support nothing more than a minimal state.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Nozick&#8217;s Wilt Chamberlain example (or Michael Jordan example) is supposed to illustrate that</li>
</ol>


<p>… liberty upsets patterns and, therefore, patterned conceptions of justice require illegitimate restrictions of liberty.</p>

<ol>
<li>Locke&#8217;s purpose in examining the &#8220;state of nature&#8221; is</li>
</ol>


<p>to determine the natural rights of human beings and, thereby, the legitimate extent of political power.</p>

<ol>
<li>According to Locke, is private propert possible in the state of nature?</li>
</ol>


<p>Yes, according to Locke, one can come to own something by mixing one&#8217;s labor with it and provided there is enough, and as good, left for others.</p>

<ol>
<li>Which of the following best characterizes the difference between Locke and Nozik on the issue of unalienable rights?</li>
</ol>


<p>Nozick thinks that I own myself, and that this means I may do whatever I want with myself - including, for instance, selling myself into slavery. Locke disagrees, he thinks, there are certain rights that I may not alienate, no matter how badly I might want to.</p>

<li>results from Betta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency</li>
<li>5-10% of all cases of diabetes</li>
<li>IDDM or juvenile-onset diabetes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Type 2</h2>

<ul>
<li>results from progressive insulin secretory defect on background of insulin resistence</li>
<li>90-95% of all cases</li>
<li>NIDDM or adult-onset diabetes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

<p>Drink glucose and test blood in 2 hour (OGTT) > 200 mg/dL</p>

<h2>Prediabetes</h2>

<p>Don&#8217;t meet criteria for diabetes, high risk for future diabetes. Usually associated with obesity (abdominal or visceral), dyslepidemia. If OGTT test shows 140-199 mg/dL.</p>

<p>If BMI > 25 and one of from the list physical inactive, high-risk race/ethinicity, hypertension (blood pressure > 140/90).</p>

<p>recommendations for prediabetes:</p>

<ul>
<li>7% body weight loss</li>
<li>regular physical activity (150 min/week)</li>
<li>spread over at least 3 days/week</li>
<li>reduce calories and fat intake</li>
<li>target heart rate 50-70% (max rate = 220 - age in yr)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Physical Activity and Weight</h2>

<p>Overweigh gain insulin resistance. 5% body weight loss associated with improved insulin sensetivity. Regular exercise has been shown to improve blood glucose control and well-being, reduce CVD risk factors and promote weight loss.</p>

<h2>Hypoglycemia</h2>

<p>Low blood sugar (&lt;70)</p>

<h2>Meal Planning</h2>

<ul>
<li>very personal</li>
<li>monitoring carbohydrate is a key</li>
<li>14g fiber per 1000 calories consumed</li>
<li>no room for soda, fruit juice</li>
<li>saturated fat should be &lt; 7% of total calories (16 g for 2000 cal diet)</li>
<li>2 drinks per day for men</li>
<li>fluids 12 8-oz cups/day</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Hypoglycemia managment</em> - 15-20 g carbohydrate and wait 15 minutes, test again and repeat if necessary.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<p>Darrell, height 5&#8217;8&#8221; (173 cm), weight 220 lbs (100 kg), BMI 33 (obese). For weight loss need 20-25 cal/kg. Exercise day 2500 calories (2000 cal rest)</p>

<ul>
<li>carbs 55% (1375 cals or 350 g)</li>
<li>protein 20% (500 cals or 125 g)</li>
<li>fat 25% (625 cals or 69 g)</li>
<li>14 g fiber per 1000 calories consumed (35 g)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Determining Calories</h2>

<p>10 calories for adult who is obese, very inactive
13 calories for adult over age 55
15 calories for a very active woman or active man
<em>20 calories</em> for a very <em>active man</em> or adult athlete</p>

<h2>Glycemic Index and Glycemid Load</h2>

<p>GI is rating system based on scale of 0 - 100, detemined experimentally (50 g carb and measure blood glucore response is measured). High-GI foods > 70, Low-GI &lt; 55. If you eat High-GI food it will cause your blood sugar to spike more rapidly (higher blood sugar).</p>

<p>GL = divide GI of a food by 100 and then multiply by grams of carb in 1 serving.</p>

<h2>Dietary Fiber and Blood sugar control</h2>

<p>Those who eat most fiber (8 grams/day) had a 30% lower risk of diabetes than those who ate least fiber from grains (3 grams/day).</p>

<p>14g fiber per 1000 calories consumed (half intake whole grains).</p>

<ul>
<li>fiber slow absorption of carbohydrate</li>
<li>leads to less marked increas in blood sugar</li>
<li>less demand for insulin</li>
</ul>


<h2>Types of fiber</h2>

<ul>
<li>gums</li>
<li>beta-glucans</li>
<li>psylium</li>
<li>resistant starches</li>
<li>pectin</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sweeteners</h2>

<p>Sucrose (glucose + fructose) - table sugar. Average american consumes 22-28 teaspoons of added sugars per day. 350 - 440 empty calories per day.</p>

<h2>Saccharin</h2>

<ul>
<li>first nonsugar</li>
<li>200-700 times sweeter than sugar</li>
<li>1970s cancer in rats</li>
<li>safe in moderate</li>
<li>stable, inexpensive</li>
</ul>


<h2>Aspartame </h2>

<ul>
<li>60-200 times sweeter than sugar</li>
<li>4kcal/gram, but 200X as sweet</li>
<li>non for cooking, used in sugar-free</li>
<li>cancer in rats, not in humans</li>
<li>people with PKU should avoid</li>
</ul>


<h2>Aceselfame K</h2>

<ul>
<li>salt that contains potassium</li>
<li>200 times sweeter than sugar</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sucralose</h2>

<ul>
<li>600 times sweeter than sucrose</li>
<li>water soluble and stable</li>
</ul>


<h2>Stevia</h2>

<ul>
<li>calorie-free</li>
<li>natural from sunflowers of C and S America</li>
<li>2008 sweetener</li>
<li>Truvia, SweetLeaf, Reb-A, PureVia</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p><strong>Justice: Markets and Morals</strong></p>

<p>What matters is that political authority or military authority <em>not be arbitraty</em>. A sergent can command a soldier to go right up to the face of a cannon where he is almost sure to die.</p>

<h2>Ways to increas recruitment</h2>

<ol>
<li>Increase pay and benefits.</li>
<li>Shift to military conscription (призыв на военную службу) (a draft, lottery).</li>
<li>Outsource - hire mercenaries (наемник).</li>
</ol>


<p>Civil war system and all-volunteer army system</p>

<ul>
<li>paid army</li>
<li>volunteer army</li>
<li>outsourcing</li>
</ul>


<p>Consent as it applies to the market exchange. Leading the market allocate military service maybe unfair and may not even be free if there is severe <em>inequality in this society</em> so that people who buy their way into military service are doing so not because they really want to, but because <em>they have so few economic opportunities</em> that&#8217;s their best choice and <em>that is an element of coercion</em>.</p>

<p>Second objection about market where military service shouldn&#8217;t be treated as just another job for pay because it bound up with patriotism and civic obligation and so we shoulnd&#8217;t allocate duties by the market.</p>

<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>sodium limit 2,300mg per day to lower blood pressure</li>
<li>potassium has good effect on lowering blood pressure (only from food, not from suppliments)</li>
</ul>


<p>Sweet potato (694 mg), beet greens (1/2 cup 655 mg), yogurt plain non-fat (8 oz 579 mg), tomato puree, bananas, spinach and so on are good source of potassium.</p>

<p>DASH meal plan to lower blood pressure.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>John Locke. Of the state of Nature.</strong></p>

<p>All men has a state of perfect freedom to order their actions within the bounds of the law of nature. A state also of equality, no one having more than another, creatures of the same cpecies and rank, have same advantages of nature, and the use of the same faculties.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 6</strong> Nothing may authroze us to destroy one another.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 7</strong> Any may do in prosecution of equality, every one must have a right to do. All men may be restrained from doing hurt to one another.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 8</strong> the only reasons, why one man may lawfully do harm to another, which is that we call punishment. Every man has a right to punish the offender and be executioner of the law of nature.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 11</strong> every man, in the state of nature, has a power to kill a murderer.</p>

<p><strong>Of the state of War</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 16</strong> Men should have a right to destroy that which threatens him with destruction. Preserver as much as possible, when all cannot be preserved, the safety of the innocent is to be preferred: and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 17</strong> freedom being the foundation of everything else and if somebody would take it away - state of war.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 18</strong> this makes it lawful for a man to kill a thief that has no right to get a man in his power, he has no reason to suppoer, that thief, who would take away libery, would not take away everything else.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 20</strong> the state of war once begun, continues, with a right to the innocent party to destroy the other whenever he can, until the aggressor offers peace.</p>

<p><strong>Of Slavery</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 22</strong> natural liberty of man - to be free from any superior power on earth and not be under the will or legislative authority of man. Liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 23</strong> no body can give more power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 24</strong> drudgery isn&#8217;t slavery, because master coud not have power to kill and men was obliged to let go free out of his service.</p>

<p><strong>Of Property</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 25</strong> Men have a right to their preservation, but how any one should ever come to have a property in any thing.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 26</strong> The earth is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. The fruit or venison (оленина), which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 27</strong> The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 28</strong> Thus the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place, where I have a right to them in common with others, become my property, without the assignation or consent of any body. The labour that was mine, removing them out of that common state they were in, hath fixed my property in them.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 29</strong> Men labor has taken it out of the hands of nature belonged equally to all her children, and hath thereby appropriated it to himself.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 32</strong> As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property.</p>

<p>If someone violates the law of nature:
- he&#8217;s aggressor
- he&#8217;s beyond reason
and you can punish him (kill him as self-defence). It&#8217;s fierce and filled with violence and that is why people want to leave it with consent. The only way to escape the state of nature is undertake an active consent where you agree to give up the enforcement power and to create a goverment where it&#8217;ll be a legislation and everyone who enters to abide whatever the majority decide.</p>

<p><em>The supreme power cannot take from any man any part fo his property without his own consent.</em></p>

<p><em>Men therefore in society having property, they have such a right to the goods, which by the law <strong>of the community</strong> are theirs&#8230;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8230;Goverments cannot be supported without great charge, and it is fit every one who enjoys his share of the protection, should pay out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it. <strong>BUT</strong> still it mush be with his own consent, ie the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves or their representatives chosen by them.</em></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="https://si0.twimg.com/help/1362431499_1831" alt="" /></p>

<p>Last Sunday I played with <a href="http://vine.co">vine.co</a> iPhone application. Vine is a mobile service that lets you create, share short videos and sure enoght is a cool app, but has a small problem - sometimes I just want to share the video link with my friends without sharing it on facebook/twitter (yes, I didn&#8217;t find how to get direct link to specific vine and the only way was to share it on twitter and then copy the link). So, Sunday, night, iPhone, mitmproxy, ruby and curiosity how to get direct link to my vine.</p>

<p>First of all you need to setting up SSL interception. Follow this <a href="http://mitmproxy.org/doc/certinstall/ios.html">instruction</a>, mitmproxy-ca.pem you can find in the config directory (~/.mitmproxy by default). Then run mitmproxy, setup http proxy on iphone and run the app, you will see requests in mimtproxy</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qWJdmQE.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here I&#8217;ll post undocumented API links I&#8217;ve found and examples which you can use to authorize, request yours posts, timeline, search users, explore by using tags and so on. To get authorization key you can use this example</p>
