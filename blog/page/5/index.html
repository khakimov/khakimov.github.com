<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>

<h2>Alcohol and Cancer</h2>

<p>Top 5 highest intake:</p>

<ol>
<li>Estonia (16.2 liters per year)</li>
<li>Czech Republic</li>
<li>Ireland</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Andorra</li>
</ol>


<p>Lowest intake in Europe:</p>

<ol>
<li>Norway (6.2 liters)</li>
<li>Sweden (6.6 liters)</li>
</ol>


<p>Alcohol increases risk of cancer:</p>

<ul>
<li>esophagus</li>
<li>mouth and throat</li>
<li>pre and post menopausal breast</li>
<li>bowel cancer in men, probable in women</li>
<li>liver</li>
<li>colorectal</li>
</ul>


<p>Alcohol and Non-Cancer risks:</p>

<ul>
<li>heart disease</li>
<li>high blood pressure</li>
<li>stroke</li>
<li>osteoporosis</li>
<li>malnutrition</li>
<li>pancreatic inflammition</li>
<li>brain damage</li>
<li>liver cirrhosis</li>
<li>accidents, violence, suicide</li>
<li>birth defects if pregnant</li>
</ul>


<p>Alcohol contributes to cancer risk:</p>

<ul>
<li>damages DNA cells during alcohol breakdown</li>
<li>produces carcinogenic compounds</li>
<li>raises levels of some hormones - such as estrogen</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Drink</em> is glass of wine (5 fl oz).</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t prove cause and effect.</p>

<p>Breast cancer (n = 105k), 3-6 drinks/week - 15% more likely to develop breast cancer. For women 6-19 drinks/week increased risk was 20%. More than 19 drinks/week risk increased 50%.</p>

<h2>Debunking (разоблачение) Diet and Cancer Myths</h2>

<p>40% of cancer survivors. Common therapies:</p>

<ul>
<li>natural products</li>
<li>deep breathing</li>
<li>meditation</li>
</ul>


<p>May opt CAM works:</p>

<ul>
<li>help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain</li>
<li>comfort themself and ease the worries</li>
<li>feel that they are doing something more to help with their own care</li>
<li>try to treat or cure their cancer</li>
</ul>


<h2>Megadosing</h2>

<p>10X dose</p>

<ul>
<li>excess vitamin C -> copper deficiency</li>
<li>phosphorus -> impair calcium absorption</li>
<li>A, D, K -> toxicity</li>
<li>E -> all-cause mortality</li>
</ul>


<p><em>&#8220;Natural&#8221;</em> means nothing. Botanical products are from plants - but plants contain many chemicals and compounds. Sugar is used by all cells in the body for energy, nothing wrong with it (&#8220;sugar feeds cancer&#8221; wrong). <em>Milk</em> and low amount of <em>calcium</em> (200 mg/day) may protect against breast cancer, at levels > <em>1500 mg/day</em> may possibly <em>increase</em> prostate cancer risk.</p>

<p><em>Microwaving</em> food in plastic wrap cause cancer? There are no dioxins in plastic. Phthalates not commonly used in plastic wraps in the US. Follow manufacturer recommendations: avoid food contact with wrap if microwaving.</p>

<p><em>Reusing plastic water bottles</em> cause cancer? Most cancer experts would say that it is a perfectly safe practice.</p>

<p><em>Superfoods and ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity)</em> is very high with antioxidence (green tea, dark green leafy vege, legumes, cruciferous veg).</p>

<h2>Nutrition Need in Cancer</h2>

<p><em>Brain and Nervous system</em> - chewing and swallowing difficulties, headaches, altered taste and smell, difficulty with self-feeding.</p>

<p><em>Head and Neck</em> - swallowing difficulty, aspiration, infralmed mucosa, dry mouth, altered taste and smell</p>

<p><em>Esophagus</em> - swallowing difficulty, aspiration, obstruction, GERD, inflamed mucosa.</p>

<p><em>Stomach</em> - anorexia and early satiety, delayed stomach emptying, dumping syndrome, malabsoprion, nutrient deficiencies.</p>

<p><em>Inestine</em> - inflamed mucosa and bacterial overgrowth, obstruction, lactose intolerance, malabsorption, bile insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte imbalances.</p>

<p><em>Pancreas</em> - decrease digestive enzume secretion, bile insufficiency, malabsorption, nutrient defficiencies, hyperglycemia.</p>

<h2>Weight Loss</h2>

<p>Loss of 10% over 6 month
Anorexia in 15-25% of cancer patients at diagnosis</p>

<p>Obese - 21-25 kcal/kg
non-ambulatory or sedentary adult - 25-30 kcal/kg
who needs gain weight - 30-35 kcal/kg
cachectic, hypermetabolic - >35 kcal/kg</p>

<h2>Protein</h2>

<ul>
<li>normal 0.8 - 1.0 g/kg</li>
<li>non-sressed cancer patient - 1-1.5 g/kg</li>
<li>bone marrow transplant - 1.5 g/kg</li>
<li>extreme wasting or hypermetabolism 1.5-2.5 g/kg</li>
<li>hepatic - 0.5-0.8 g/kg</li>
</ul>


<p>A, C, folate vitamins
Fe, Mg, Zn, Cu materials</p>

<h2>Tips for increast calories and proteins in meals</h2>

<ul>
<li>butter or margarine</li>
<li>cream cheese</li>
<li>nuts</li>
<li>cream, whole milk</li>
<li>eggs</li>
<li>meats</li>
<li>oral supplements between meals</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Justice</strong></p>

<h2>Immanuel Kant</h2>

<p>Not to use people as means even for good ends. Difficult thinker. The book is about what the supreme principle of morality is and it&#8217;s also gives us an account one of the most powerful accounts we have of what <em>freedom</em> really is.</p>

<p>Kant rejected utilitarism. He thinks that every human beings have a certain dignity (достоинство) that commands our respect. The resaon the individual is sacred or the bearer of right according to Kant, doesn&#8217;t stem from the idea that we own ourselves, but instead from the idea that we are all <em>ratinal beings</em>. Which means we are beings <em>who are capable of reason</em>. We also <em>autonomous beings</em> which is to say that we are beings capable of acting and choosing <em>freely</em>.</p>

<p>Kant admints the utilitarians were half right, we seek to avoid pain and we like plreasure. He does deny is <em>Bentham&#8217;s</em> clain that <strong>pain and pleasure are our sovereign (верховный) masters</strong>. Kant thinks that&#8217;s wrong, it&#8217;s rational capacity that makes us distinctive, that makes us special, that <em>set us apart from and above mere animal existence</em>. It makes us something more than just physical creatures with appetites.</p>

<h2>Kant about freedom</h2>

<p>When we like animals seek after pleasure or the satisfaction of our desires of the avoidance pain when we do that we arean&#8217;t really acting freely. We realy acting as the slaves of those appetites and impulses.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t choose this particular hunger or that particular appetite, and so when I act to satisfy it I&#8217;m just acting accorind to natural necessity and for Kant <em>freedom is opposite of necessity</em>.</p>

<p>obey your thirst - example with Sprite slogan. You think you choosing freely Sprite or Pepsi, but you&#8217;re actually obeying something, a thirst, or maybe a desire manufactured or messaged by advertising.</p>

<p>How can my will be detemined if not by prompting subnature or my hunger or my appetite or my desires? <em>Kant&#8217;s conception of freedom</em></p>

<p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>to act freely is to act autonomously = is to act according to a law that I give myself. (not according to the physical laws of nature or to the laws of cause and effect which include <em>my desire, to eat or to drink or to choose this food in a restaurant over that</em>)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Heteronomy</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>when I act heteronomously I&#8217;m acting according to an inclination (наклонность, склон, предрасположение) or a desire that I haven&#8217;t chosen for myself.</p></blockquote>

<p>To act <em>freely</em> is not to choose the best means to a given end - it&#8217;s to choose the end itself for its own sake. (here is example with bilard ball which according to the law of nature/law of gravity will drop on the floor and can only follow this rules, when himan being can do - choose the end itself).</p>

<p>We act as means to the realization of ends given outside us, we are instruments rather than authors of the purposes we pursue. (<em>heteronomy</em>)</p>

<p>When we act as autonomus we cease to be instruments to purposes given outside us, we become or we can come to think of ourselves as ends in ourselves. (it gives humans special dignity)</p>

<p><em>respecting human dignity</em> means regarding persons not just as means but also as end themselves (this is why it&#8217;s wrong to use people for the sake of other people well being of happiness). (this is why Kant thinks utilitarianism goes wrong, it&#8217;s important to respect the dignity of persons and to uphold (поддерживать) their rights). Freedom as autonomy.</p>

<p>What gives an action it&#8217;s moral worth? What makes an action morally worthy consists not in the conseqiences or in the results that flow from it - morally worthy has to do with the motive with the quality of the will with the intention for which the act is down and the motive must be of a certain kind.</p>

<p><strong>Kant&#8217;s conception of morality</strong></p>

<p>Moral worth of an action depens of motive (do the right thing for the right reason)</p>

<blockquote><p>A good will isn&#8217;t good because of what effects or accomplishes, it&#8217;s good in itself. Even if by utmost (все возможное) effort the good will accomplishes nothing it would still shine like a jewel for its own sake as something which has its full value in itself. Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Duty (moral worth an action is the motive of duty) <strong>VS</strong> Inclination (desires)</em></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Shopkeeper and inexperienced customer comes in, shopkepeer know that he could give the customer the wrong change. But reputation would be damaged and I would lose business, so I won&#8217;t shortchange this customer. Shopkepeer does nothing wrong, he gives a correct change, but <em>does this action have moral worth?</em> Kant says NO, because shopkepeer did it with wrong motive - out of self-interest.</p>

<p>Suicide.</p>

<p>Better bussines bureau - honest is the best policy, it&#8217;s also the most profitable.</p>

<h2>Meat consumption</h2>

<ul>
<li>1999: 218 million tons annual, global</li>
<li>2030: 376 million tons annually predicted</li>
</ul>


<p>Consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with increased risk colorectal cancer. Limit &lt;500 g peer week.</p>

<ul>
<li>Heme iron in red meat</li>
<li>Carcinogens formed during high heat cooking</li>
<li>Nitres in meat</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fiber and Colon Cancer</h2>

<p>10% risk reduction in colorectal cancer for each 10 grams of fiber eaten per day.</p>

<h2>Calcium</h2>

<p>Decreased risk particularly pronounced in colorectal cancer. Risk decresed up to 1300 mg/day.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>5 times per week had 20% lower risk colon cancer than men who rarely/never exercised. 20% higher risk for men who watched TV or videos for 5-6 hours a day than men who watched less than 3 hours.</p>

<h2>Prostate Cancer and Diet</h2>

<ul>
<li>second most common cancer in men</li>
<li>14% of all new cancer in men (2008)</li>

<p>Diet high in <em>lycopene</em> could prevent 11% of prostate cancer in US/year. Recommends eating at least 5 portions a day of fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p><em>Selenium</em> supplement use reduces prostate cancer risk (overall evidence on supplements and cancer is inconsistent). In plant food, soil content, brazil nuts, oatmeal, some animal food.</p>

<p>Calcium, milk and dairy, processed meat could increase the risk. Legumes including soy and food with vitamin E could reduce risk as well as cruciferous vegetables and omega-3 fatty acid intake.</p>

<h2>Nutrition Impact of Prostate Cancer</h2>

<ul>
<li>radical prostatectomy</li>
<li>cryotherapy</li>
<li>radiation</li>
<li>hormonal therapy</li>
</ul>


<p>Selenium (200 mg/d) and Vitamin E (400 IU/day) no lower of prostate cancer versus placebo.</p>

<p>2 glasses nonfat milk per day had 23% > risk prostate cancer. IGF-1 levels had 39% higher risk of prostate cancer than those with lowels levels.</p>

<p>1500-2000 mg calcium/day had 87% hight risk of fatal prostate cancer compared to those who gat less than 750 mg/day. Risk was 2.5 times hight for those 2000 mg/day.</p>

<h2>Summary recommendations</h2>

<ul>
<li>selenium 55 mcg</li>
<li>vitamin E 33 IU</li>
<li>calcium 1200 mg</li>

<li>breastfeeding your baby may decrease both pre and post menopausal breast cancer risk</li>
<li>family history (5-10%)</li>
<li>inactivity</li>
<li>weight</li>
</ul>


<p>Those with breast cancer in immediate family but who had <em>breasfeed</em> developed only 41% as many cancers as those with family member with cancer but didn&#8217;t breastfeed. Breastfeeding from 2 to 6 months.</p>

<p><em>Soy food</em> do not increase any cancer risk, may even help lower risk (not proven). General guidelines are to avoid soy supplements.</p>

<p><em>Fiber</em> 5% reduction in breast cancer for each additional 10 grams fiber per day consumed. Inverse association between dietary fiber intake and breast cancer risk.</p>

<p><em>Calcium</em> recommended dose 1500 mg calcium, 400-800 IU vitamin D per day.</p>

<p><em>38% could be prevent</em> - maintain healthy weight, physical active, drink less alcohol, breastfeed the baby.</p>

<p><strong>Justice</strong></p>

<p>Egg donor from a woman who was intelenget, athletic, 5&#8221;10&#8217;, 1400 SAT. $50k</p>

<p>Sperm - $70.</p>

<p><em>Egg or sperm should or not to sold for money?</em></p>

<p>Mrs. Stern met Mary 29, surrogate mother. They&#8217;ve made a deal, 10k$ in exchange AI with Stern sperm and give the baby to the Sterns.</p>

<p>Objections to enforcing surrogacy contracts:
- tainted (испорчен, запятнан) constent 1) coercion 2) lack of information.
- dehumanizing</p>

<p>Court said the contract is enforceable. NJ supremecourt said ths contract is uneforceable:</p>

<p>Under the contract the natural motther is irrevocably committed before she know the strength of her bond with her child. She never makes a truly voluntary, informed decision, for any decision prior to the baby&#8217;s birth is, in the most important sense, uninformed.</p>

<p>This is the sale of a child, or, the very least, the sale of a mother&#8217;s right to her child&#8230; Whatever idealism may motivate the participants, the profit motive predomintates, permeates, and ultimately governs the transaction.</p>

<p>Emotionals bond to the child.</p>

<p><strong>Mill&#8217;s Utilitarianism</strong></p>

<p>Respect people rights is a way of making everybody better of in the long run.</p>

<p>Strong theory of rights that says individual matter not just as instruments to be used for a larger social purpose or for the sake of maximazing utility, individuals are separate beings with separate lives worthy of respect.</p>

<p><em>Liberarianism</em> takes individual rights seriosly, because it say the fundemntal individual right is the right to liberty. Because we are separate humans we have individual right to libery, and that means the right to choose freely to live our lives as we please provided with respect other people&#8217;s rights.</p>

<blockquote><p>Inviduals have rights so strong and far-reaching are these rights that they raise the quiestion of what, if anything the state may do. Robert Nozick</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Libertarian view of goverment</h2>

<ol>
<li>No Paternalist Legislation (that&#8217;s passing laws that protect people from themselves, seatbelt for example)</li>
<li>No Morals Legislation (moral values of the society, gays and lesbians)</li>
<li>No Redistribution of income from rich to poor.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Nozick</strong>: What makes income distribution just?</p>

<ol>
<li>Justice in Acquisition (initial holdings, did people get the things they use to get their money fairly, ex. stole factory, land)</li>
<li>Justice in Transfer (free choice buying and selling things, free market)</li>
</ol>


<p>Nozick agrees that taxation is theft</p>

<p>Taxation = taking of earnings, in other words it means taking the fruits of my labor, but if the state has a right to take my earnings or the fruits of my labor.</p>

<p><em>Taking of earnings = forced labor.</em> Because forced labor involves in taking of my leisure, my time, my effors.</p>

<p><em>Forced labor = slavery</em></p>

<p><em>Violates Principle of Self-Possession</em></p>

<p>To coerce someone to use some person for the sake of the general welfare is wrong, bc it calls to the question of fundumental fact that we own ourselves <strong>self-possession or self ownership</strong>.</p>

<p>Objections to libertarianism:</p>

<ol>
<li>The poor need the money more</li>
<li>Taxation by consent of the governed is not coerced</li>
<li>The successfil owe a debt to society</li>
</ol>


<p>Liberitarians combat the utility idea of using people as means for the collective happiness by saying the way to put a stop to that utilitarian logic of using persons is to resort to the intuitively powerful idea that <em>we are the proprietors of our own person</em>.</p>

<p>Nozick borrows some idea from John Locke where he accounted for the rise of private property from the state of nature by a chain of reasoning very similar to the one that Nozick and the libertarians use. John Locke said private property arises because when we mix our labor with things unowned things we come to acquire a property right in those things.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>John Locke</strong></p>

<p>There are certain fundamental individual rights include a natural right to life libery and property and he argues that the right to property is not just a creation of goverment or law, <em>the law of property</em> is a natural rightin the sence it is pre-political, it&#8217;s a right that attaches to individuals as human beings. He says the state of nature is the state of liberty, human beings are free and equal beings, there is no natural hierarchy and yet there&#8217;s a difference between a state of libery and the state of licence.</p>

<p>Even I&#8217;m free, i&#8217;m not free to violate the law of nature, take my own life or to sell myself to slavery (You are the creature of God and God has a bigger property right in us).</p>

<blockquote><p>For men, being all the workmanship (мастерство) of one omnipotent (всемогущий), and infinitely wise maker (God), they are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one another&#8217;s pleasure. John Locke</p>

<p>Freedom can&#8217;t just be a matter of doing whatever we want. The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it which obliges everyone: and reason, which is that law, teches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possession (владение).</p></blockquote>

<p>Natural rights is inalienable (неотъемлемые). <strong>Inalienable</strong> it&#8217;s not for us to alienate(отчуждать) them or to get them up to give them a way to trade them the way, to sell them.</p>

<p><em>Airlines tickets are inalienable</em>, I own them in the limited sense that I can use them for myself, but I can&#8217;t trade them away.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has any right to but himself. The labor of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. John Locke</p>

<p>Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature has provided, and left it in, he has mixed his labor with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. John Locke</p>

<p>For this labor being the unqestionable property of the laborer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good left in common for others. John Locke</p>

<p>As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates and can use the product of, so much is his property. He by his labor does, as it were, enclose it from the common.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Quiz 2 (Justice)</h1>

<ol>
<li>According to Robert Nozick, the state is justified to tax a citizen (even against his or her will) if:</li>
</ol>


<p>The answer is <em>the taxes are used to support nothing more than a minimal state.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Nozick&#8217;s Wilt Chamberlain example (or Michael Jordan example) is supposed to illustrate that</li>
</ol>


<p>… liberty upsets patterns and, therefore, patterned conceptions of justice require illegitimate restrictions of liberty.</p>

<ol>
<li>Locke&#8217;s purpose in examining the &#8220;state of nature&#8221; is</li>
</ol>


<p>to determine the natural rights of human beings and, thereby, the legitimate extent of political power.</p>

<ol>
<li>According to Locke, is private propert possible in the state of nature?</li>
</ol>


<p>Yes, according to Locke, one can come to own something by mixing one&#8217;s labor with it and provided there is enough, and as good, left for others.</p>

<ol>
<li>Which of the following best characterizes the difference between Locke and Nozik on the issue of unalienable rights?</li>
</ol>


<p>Nozick thinks that I own myself, and that this means I may do whatever I want with myself - including, for instance, selling myself into slavery. Locke disagrees, he thinks, there are certain rights that I may not alienate, no matter how badly I might want to.</p>

<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>

<h2>Definitions and Diagnoses</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chronic disease</li>
<li>Occurs when pancreas doesn&#8217;t produce enough insulin</li>
<li>or when pancreas cannot effectively use the insulin it produces</li>
<li>hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)</li>
<li>leading cause of blindness, amputation and kidney failure</li>
<li>347 million people</li>
<li>deaths will double between 2005 and 2030</li>
<li>26 million in US (diagnosed 18.8 million and undiagnosed 7 million)</li>
<li>prediabetes 79 million people</li>
<li>2.4 cost more for people with diabete</li>
</ul>


<h2>Type 1</h2>

<ul>
<li>results from Betta-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency</li>
<li>5-10% of all cases of diabetes</li>
<li>IDDM or juvenile-onset diabetes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Type 2</h2>

<ul>
<li>results from progressive insulin secretory defect on background of insulin resistence</li>
<li>90-95% of all cases</li>
<li>NIDDM or adult-onset diabetes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

<p>Drink glucose and test blood in 2 hour (OGTT) > 200 mg/dL</p>

<h2>Prediabetes</h2>

<p>Don&#8217;t meet criteria for diabetes, high risk for future diabetes. Usually associated with obesity (abdominal or visceral), dyslepidemia. If OGTT test shows 140-199 mg/dL.</p>

<p>If BMI > 25 and one of from the list physical inactive, high-risk race/ethinicity, hypertension (blood pressure > 140/90).</p>

<p>recommendations for prediabetes:</p>

<ul>
<li>7% body weight loss</li>
<li>regular physical activity (150 min/week)</li>
<li>spread over at least 3 days/week</li>
<li>reduce calories and fat intake</li>
<li>target heart rate 50-70% (max rate = 220 - age in yr)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Physical Activity and Weight</h2>

<p>Overweigh gain insulin resistance. 5% body weight loss associated with improved insulin sensetivity. Regular exercise has been shown to improve blood glucose control and well-being, reduce CVD risk factors and promote weight loss.</p>

<h2>Hypoglycemia</h2>

<p>Low blood sugar (&lt;70)</p>

<h2>Meal Planning</h2>

<ul>
<li>very personal</li>
<li>monitoring carbohydrate is a key</li>
<li>14g fiber per 1000 calories consumed</li>
<li>no room for soda, fruit juice</li>
<li>saturated fat should be &lt; 7% of total calories (16 g for 2000 cal diet)</li>
<li>2 drinks per day for men</li>
<li>fluids 12 8-oz cups/day</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Hypoglycemia managment</em> - 15-20 g carbohydrate and wait 15 minutes, test again and repeat if necessary.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<p>Darrell, height 5&#8217;8&#8221; (173 cm), weight 220 lbs (100 kg), BMI 33 (obese). For weight loss need 20-25 cal/kg. Exercise day 2500 calories (2000 cal rest)</p>

<ul>
<li>carbs 55% (1375 cals or 350 g)</li>
<li>protein 20% (500 cals or 125 g)</li>
<li>fat 25% (625 cals or 69 g)</li>
<li>14 g fiber per 1000 calories consumed (35 g)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Determining Calories</h2>

<p>10 calories for adult who is obese, very inactive
13 calories for adult over age 55
15 calories for a very active woman or active man
<em>20 calories</em> for a very <em>active man</em> or adult athlete</p>

<h2>Glycemic Index and Glycemid Load</h2>

<p>GI is rating system based on scale of 0 - 100, detemined experimentally (50 g carb and measure blood glucore response is measured). High-GI foods > 70, Low-GI &lt; 55. If you eat High-GI food it will cause your blood sugar to spike more rapidly (higher blood sugar).</p>

<p>GL = divide GI of a food by 100 and then multiply by grams of carb in 1 serving.</p>

<h2>Dietary Fiber and Blood sugar control</h2>

<p>Those who eat most fiber (8 grams/day) had a 30% lower risk of diabetes than those who ate least fiber from grains (3 grams/day).</p>

<p>14g fiber per 1000 calories consumed (half intake whole grains).</p>

<ul>
<li>fiber slow absorption of carbohydrate</li>
<li>leads to less marked increas in blood sugar</li>
<li>less demand for insulin</li>
</ul>


<h2>Types of fiber</h2>

<ul>
<li>gums</li>
<li>beta-glucans</li>
<li>psylium</li>
<li>resistant starches</li>
<li>pectin</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sweeteners</h2>

<p>Sucrose (glucose + fructose) - table sugar. Average american consumes 22-28 teaspoons of added sugars per day. 350 - 440 empty calories per day.</p>

<h2>Saccharin</h2>

<ul>
<li>first nonsugar</li>
<li>200-700 times sweeter than sugar</li>
<li>1970s cancer in rats</li>
<li>safe in moderate</li>
<li>stable, inexpensive</li>
</ul>


<h2>Aspartame </h2>

<ul>
<li>60-200 times sweeter than sugar</li>
<li>4kcal/gram, but 200X as sweet</li>
<li>non for cooking, used in sugar-free</li>
<li>cancer in rats, not in humans</li>
<li>people with PKU should avoid</li>
</ul>


<h2>Aceselfame K</h2>

<ul>
<li>salt that contains potassium</li>
<li>200 times sweeter than sugar</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sucralose</h2>

<ul>
<li>600 times sweeter than sucrose</li>
<li>water soluble and stable</li>
</ul>


<h2>Stevia</h2>

<ul>
<li>calorie-free</li>
<li>natural from sunflowers of C and S America</li>
<li>2008 sweetener</li>
<li>Truvia, SweetLeaf, Reb-A, PureVia</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p><strong>Justice: Markets and Morals</strong></p>

<p>What matters is that political authority or military authority <em>not be arbitraty</em>. A sergent can command a soldier to go right up to the face of a cannon where he is almost sure to die.</p>

<h2>Ways to increas recruitment</h2>

<ol>
<li>Increase pay and benefits.</li>
<li>Shift to military conscription (призыв на военную службу) (a draft, lottery).</li>
<li>Outsource - hire mercenaries (наемник).</li>
</ol>


<p>Civil war system and all-volunteer army system</p>

<ul>
<li>paid army</li>
<li>volunteer army</li>
<li>outsourcing</li>
</ul>


<p>Consent as it applies to the market exchange. Leading the market allocate military service maybe unfair and may not even be free if there is severe <em>inequality in this society</em> so that people who buy their way into military service are doing so not because they really want to, but because <em>they have so few economic opportunities</em> that&#8217;s their best choice and <em>that is an element of coercion</em>.</p>

<p>Second objection about market where military service shouldn&#8217;t be treated as just another job for pay because it bound up with patriotism and civic obligation and so we shoulnd&#8217;t allocate duties by the market.</p>

<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>sodium limit 2,300mg per day to lower blood pressure</li>
<li>potassium has good effect on lowering blood pressure (only from food, not from suppliments)</li>
</ul>


<p>Sweet potato (694 mg), beet greens (1/2 cup 655 mg), yogurt plain non-fat (8 oz 579 mg), tomato puree, bananas, spinach and so on are good source of potassium.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>John Locke. Of the state of Nature.</strong></p>

<p>All men has a state of perfect freedom to order their actions within the bounds of the law of nature. A state also of equality, no one having more than another, creatures of the same cpecies and rank, have same advantages of nature, and the use of the same faculties.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 6</strong> Nothing may authroze us to destroy one another.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 7</strong> Any may do in prosecution of equality, every one must have a right to do. All men may be restrained from doing hurt to one another.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 8</strong> the only reasons, why one man may lawfully do harm to another, which is that we call punishment. Every man has a right to punish the offender and be executioner of the law of nature.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 11</strong> every man, in the state of nature, has a power to kill a murderer.</p>

<p><strong>Of the state of War</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 16</strong> Men should have a right to destroy that which threatens him with destruction. Preserver as much as possible, when all cannot be preserved, the safety of the innocent is to be preferred: and one may destroy a man who makes war upon him.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 17</strong> freedom being the foundation of everything else and if somebody would take it away - state of war.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 18</strong> this makes it lawful for a man to kill a thief that has no right to get a man in his power, he has no reason to suppoer, that thief, who would take away libery, would not take away everything else.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 20</strong> the state of war once begun, continues, with a right to the innocent party to destroy the other whenever he can, until the aggressor offers peace.</p>

<p><strong>Of Slavery</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 22</strong> natural liberty of man - to be free from any superior power on earth and not be under the will or legislative authority of man. Liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 23</strong> no body can give more power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 24</strong> drudgery isn&#8217;t slavery, because master coud not have power to kill and men was obliged to let go free out of his service.</p>

<p><strong>Of Property</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sec 25</strong> Men have a right to their preservation, but how any one should ever come to have a property in any thing.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 26</strong> The earth is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. The fruit or venison (оленина), which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 27</strong> The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 28</strong> Thus the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place, where I have a right to them in common with others, become my property, without the assignation or consent of any body. The labour that was mine, removing them out of that common state they were in, hath fixed my property in them.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 29</strong> Men labor has taken it out of the hands of nature belonged equally to all her children, and hath thereby appropriated it to himself.</p>

<p><strong>Sec 32</strong> As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property.</p>

<p>If someone violates the law of nature:
- he&#8217;s aggressor
- he&#8217;s beyond reason
and you can punish him (kill him as self-defence). It&#8217;s fierce and filled with violence and that is why people want to leave it with consent. The only way to escape the state of nature is undertake an active consent where you agree to give up the enforcement power and to create a goverment where it&#8217;ll be a legislation and everyone who enters to abide whatever the majority decide.</p>

<p><em>The supreme power cannot take from any man any part fo his property without his own consent.</em></p>

<p><em>Men therefore in society having property, they have such a right to the goods, which by the law <strong>of the community</strong> are theirs&#8230;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8230;Goverments cannot be supported without great charge, and it is fit every one who enjoys his share of the protection, should pay out of his estate his proportion for the maintenance of it. <strong>BUT</strong> still it mush be with his own consent, ie the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves or their representatives chosen by them.</em></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="https://si0.twimg.com/help/1362431499_1831" alt="" /></p>

<p>Last Sunday I played with <a href="http://vine.co">vine.co</a> iPhone application. Vine is a mobile service that lets you create, share short videos and sure enoght is a cool app, but has a small problem - sometimes I just want to share the video link with my friends without sharing it on facebook/twitter (yes, I didn&#8217;t find how to get direct link to specific vine and the only way was to share it on twitter and then copy the link). So, Sunday, night, iPhone, mitmproxy, ruby and curiosity how to get direct link to my vine.</p>

<p>First of all you need to setting up SSL interception. Follow this <a href="http://mitmproxy.org/doc/certinstall/ios.html">instruction</a>, mitmproxy-ca.pem you can find in the config directory (~/.mitmproxy by default). Then run mitmproxy, setup http proxy on iphone and run the app, you will see requests in mimtproxy</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qWJdmQE.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here I&#8217;ll post undocumented API links I&#8217;ve found and examples which you can use to authorize, request yours posts, timeline, search users, explore by using tags and so on. To get authorization key you can use this example</p>

		<p>I wrote the post <a href="http://khakimov.com/blog/2012/11/24/what-is-wrong-with-http-secure/">What Is Wrong With HTTP Secure</a> and my friend gave me an idea to try just rewrite hardcoded link (http:// -> https://). The beauty of JS are simplicity, documentations and tons of examples, so even if you don&#8217;t know how to get element without using jQuery it will be easy to figure out in couple minutes as I did in the night.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2012/12/09/bypassing-dep-slash-aslr-protections/">Bypassing DEP/ASLR Protections</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today we are going to learn about data execution prevention (DEP) and address space layout randomization (ASLR). Last Sunday I read about <a href="http://khakimov.com/blog/2012/12/02/return-into-libc-without-function-calls/">return-into-libc</a> and one week before was post about <a href="http://khakimov.com/blog/2012/11/20/buffer-overflow/">buffer overflow</a> as-is. Both methods reqired to know the address of attacker shellcode and/or standard kernel library (we found out the address of system() function in the memory to use it in <strong>return-into-libc</strong> with this code int main() { system();}). Modern systems decided to implement something what will make stack addresses and addressess of library routines unpredictable and different from machine to machine (no more universal exploits =) kidding).</p>

<p>Author <a href="https://twitter.com/justdionysus">Dionysus Blazakis</a> holds BS from University of Maryland and doing interesting things, I saw his presentation &#8220;The Apple Sandbox&#8221; and then found this paper, great job Dionysus. I inspired by his example and it motivates me to keep digging in research field. Dion, if you&#8217;ll ever read this I just want to say thank you! Lets get back to his paper and read what this smart fellow prepared for us.</p>

<p><a title="View Blazakis on Scribd" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/116197211/Blazakis" style="margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;">Blazakis</a><iframe class="scribd_iframe_embed" src="http://www.scribd.com/embeds/116197211/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-1dr5xy06ojvmp97eq1hg" data-auto-height="false" data-aspect-ratio="0.772727272727273" scrolling="no" id="doc_39852" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>DEP and ASLR are very real problem in the side of an exploit developer. DEP makes locating shellcode difficult, ASLR further complicates an attack by obfuscating the base address of the loaded data. Adobe Flash Player is used as an example, Dion also referenced to JIT spraying (Just-In-Time).</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>A Just-in-time compiler (JIT), by definition, produces machine 
</span><span class='line'>code as its output. Since it produces executable data, a JIT 
</span><span class='line'>compiler is one of the few types of programs that **cannot** be 
</span><span class='line'>run in a **no-executable-data environment**. Therefore, JIT 
</span><span class='line'>compilers are normally exempt from data execution prevention. A 
</span><span class='line'>JIT spray compiles code that then proceeds to spray the memory 
</span><span class='line'>with enough instances of exploit code to overwhelm the address 
</span><span class='line'>space randomization and execute the exploit itself.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>JIT spraying is very simular to heap spraying, in simple terms attacker stuff heap with multiple copies of attack code (payload) and that increases the chances of successful exploitation.</p>

<p>So, why do you need this? If you found the overflow in the modern browsers you will not able to use it easily, because of randomization, the address space is randomized and you don&#8217;t know where to point EIP and even if you have data in the heap DEP wont allow you to execute it. But you can use Just-In-Time compiler which will allocate writable memory for you and write executable code into it. For more details please read the paper above. Enjoy!</p>
