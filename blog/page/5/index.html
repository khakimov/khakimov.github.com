<hr />

<h1>The Value of Life</h1>

<p>Example with rat and orgasmic impulse, when they stop eat and having sex except but clicking button with this impulses. Why we could not imagine doing same thing with us? <strong>There&#8217;s something that distinguishes humans from rats.</strong> No doubt you would enjoy it for a very long time. But I imagine that after a period, part of you is going to start asking, &#8220;Huh, say, it feels the same as it was yesterday and the day before that and the day before that.&#8221; I imagine this is how it&#8217;s going to feel tomorrow, and the day after that and the day after that. And eventually this question would start, <strong>&#8220;is this really all there is to life, just simple pleasure like this?&#8221;</strong> You are not just going to stay caught in the moment. You&#8217;re going to take this meta-level or higher level standpoint, look down at the pleasure and wonder, &#8220;Is this all that there is to life?&#8221; and this question will override the pleasure, <strong>eventually, you&#8217;d become hirrified that you were, in effect, stuck in this rat-like existence.</strong></p>

<p>Immortality can&#8217;t be something desirable, it would be a nightmare, something you would long to free yourself from.</p>

<p>So parhaps the best form of life would be not immortality; and not what we&#8217;ve got now, where you live after a mere drop of 50 or 80 or 100 years. But rather the best thing I suppose would be to be able to live as long as you wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Is it worth continuing to live or is it not wort continuing to live?</strong></p>

<p>good life vs bad life?</p>

<p>The things that are worth having for their own sake, philosophers call <strong>intrinsically valuable</strong>. Instrumentally good or bad things in the list about good vs bad life.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s worth having for its own sake?</strong> Well, one natural suggestion is that pleasure (intrinsically good) is worth having for its own sake and pain (intrinsically bad) is probably worth avoiding for its own sake.</p>

<p>Hedonism is a view that many people are attracted to, it&#8217;s got a very simple theory of the nature of wellbeing. Being well of is a matter of experiencing pleasure and avoiding or minimizing the expirience of pain.</p>

<p>In deciding whether what life holds for you is worth having, better than nothing, you, roughly speaking, add up all the good times and substract all the bad times and see whether the net balance is positive or negative.</p>

<p><strong>Add up all the pleasures, subtract all the pains.</strong></p>

<p>If only I had chosen to become a doctor, instead of having chosen to become a lawyer. How much better off or worse off would I have been? Or if I decide to become an artice or a scholar or a beach bum or a farmer, how much better off or worse off would I have been? You&#8217;re trying to project your future and asking the question &#8220;Where do I think I&#8217;d be better off?&#8221;, which of these branches that are available to me, the branches of my life story which is the one in which the future from here on our holds more pleasure and holds less pain. That&#8217;s how hedonist will think about choises.</p>

<p>We can evaluate this year, or 6 month, or just this evening. I can talk about, well, what should I do tonight? Shoild I stay home and work on my paper? Should I go to the party? Where will I be better off tonight?</p>

<p>We do our evaluation not for the entire lives, but of chunk of lives. That what we can do if we&#8217;re accept hedonism. <strong>Should we accept hedonism?</strong></p>

<p>Robert Nozick, a philosopher who died a few years ago. Nizick invited us to imagine an experience machine, that&#8217;s offer us not just simple rat-machine with impulses to generate pleasure in our brain, he offers, basically, completely realistic virtual reality. When you are hooked up to the machine, it seems to you exactly the same on the inside as it would seem to you if you really were.</p>

<p>You coud have the identical experience of climbing Mount Everest, you&#8217;d feel the wind bracing you. You feel the thrill of having made it to the top and the wind bracingly striking your chin and you feel the satisfaction and you&#8217;ve got the memories of having almost died. Or <strong>write the great american novel</strong> then you&#8217;ve got the experience of staying up late at night not knowing how to make the plot work out, crushing pieces of paper and throwing them away. Or you want to be <strong>finding the cure for cancer</strong>. So you&#8217;ve got exactrly the experience you would have if you were working in your lab having the brilliant breakthrough when you finally realize what the combination is that would make the right antibody. That&#8217;s life on the experience machine. You&#8217;re not doing any of it, you just floating in the lab. But the experience are <strong>identical</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, ask youself then, would you want to spend your life hooked up to the experience machine? How would you feel if you discovered now that you have been living your life hooked up to an experience machine? <strong>Is it the best possible form of human existence?</strong></p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/08/16/august-16-friday/">[Death] 18. The Badness of Death, Part III</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lucretious says, look, most of us are upset and anxious at the fact that we&#8217;re going to die. We think death is bad for us. There&#8217;ll be this period after my death in which I won&#8217;t exist. And deprivation account helps us to say why it&#8217;s bad, because during this period of nonexistence, you&#8217;re not enjoying the good things in life. But wait a minute, <em>the period after you die isn&#8217;t the only period during which you don&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s not the only period in which if only you were still alive, you could still be enjoying the good things in life. There&#8217;s another period of nonexistence.</em> <strong>It&#8217;s the period before my birth</strong></p>

<p>It is bad? Lucretius says that&#8217;s silly, nobody upset about the fact that there was an eternity before they were born.</p>

<p>Before born you don&#8217;t life, but with death you lost it. So, we can say, that we care about that part after death more than the one before birth. <strong>Because the one after death involves loss, and the one before birth does not.</strong></p>

<p>We imaging to living the longer life. But what is it that happens when I say, if only I&#8217;d been born earlier? Well, says <strong>Feldman</strong>, you don&#8217;t actually imagine a longer life, you just shift the entire life and start it earlier. When we imaging being born earlier we don&#8217;t imaging having longer life. Nothing better about having a life earlier, according to the deprivation account.</p>

<p>So, Feldman says, no wonder, no surprise that you care about the nonexistence after death. Because when you imagine that being different, you imagine a longer life. But when you start thinking about the nonexistence before birth and you imagine that being different, you don&#8217;t imagine more goods in life, you just imagine them taking place at a different time.</p>

<p>Derek Parfit says, it&#8217;s true that when I think about the nonexistence after I die that&#8217;s loss, whereas the nonexistence before I&#8217;m born, that&#8217;s not loss, that&#8217;s mere &#8220;schmoss&#8221;. And it&#8217;s true that we need an explanation about why loss is worse than &#8220;schmoss&#8221;. But we can see that this is not an arbitrary preference on our part, because in fact, it&#8217;s part of a quite general pattern we have of caring about the future in a way that we don&#8217;t care about the past. <strong>This is a very deep fact about human caring. We are oriented towards the future and concerned about what happens in it, in a way that we&#8217;re not oriented and concerned about what happened in the past.</strong></p>

<p>Parfit&#8217;e got a very nice example, imagine that you&#8217;ve got some condition, some sort of medical condition that will kill you unless you have an operation. So fair enought, you&#8217;re going to have the operation. This will allow you to live your life. Unfortunately in order to perfom the operation, they can&#8217;t have you anesthetized. You have to be awayke, perhaps in order to tell the surgeon &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s where it hurts,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a very painful operation. Only one thing we can do is this: give a super local medication and you will not remember anything about the operation itself (24 hours completely wiped out). So you&#8217;re in the hospital and you wake up and you ask yourself, &#8220;Huh, have I had the operation yet or not?&#8221; Don&#8217;t know, right? So you ask the nurse, &#8220;Have I had the operation yet or not?&#8221; She says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, we have a couple on the hall today who are some of whom have had it and some of whom are scheduled to have it later today. Let me go look at your file, I&#8217;ll come back and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221; I want it to be the case that I&#8217;m one of the people who&#8217;s already had the operation. I don&#8217;t want to be one of the people who hasn&#8217;t yet had the operation. <strong>We want the pain to be in the past.</strong> We care more about what&#8217;s happening in the futer than we care about what&#8217;s happening in the past.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Revolution</h1>

<blockquote><p>In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. Communist Manifesto</p></blockquote>

<p>1848 - 1852 what Marx experiences is a period of great disillusion.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.</p>

<p>The present generation is like the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It now only has a new world to conquer, it must go under in order to make room for the men who are able to cope with a new world. The Class Struggles in France</p></blockquote>

<p>Febraury revolution most the beautiful revolution, it was when everybody was the brother and sisters were all fighting for the same cause. But later on in June of 1848 you get the ugly revoltion. The workers are in the streets of Paris, saying, we want jobs, we want food, we want wages, will allowe us to live well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called June Day.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Febraury revolution was the beautiful revolution, the revolution of universal sympathy, because the contradictions which erupted in it against the monarchy were still undeveloped and peacefully dormant, because the social struggle which formed their background had only achieved an ephemeral existence, and existence in phrases, in words. The June revoulution is the ugly revolution, the nasty revolution, because the phrases have given place to the real thing&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>The <strong>realy real</strong> for Marx is class strugle. After the revolution 1848 the realy real become <strong>economic law</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>What taste! What cuisine! What wines! And what speeches! Nothing could make me more scornful of success, considering the price at which it is purchased. I sat unmoved, nauseated by the patriotic fervor they whipped up with mealy platitudes such as &#8216;the abyss toward which we are running&#8217; the &#8216;honor of our flag,&#8217; the &#8216;shadow cast by our standards,&#8217; the &#8216;fraternity of peoples.&#8217; Never will there be a quarter as many ovations for the most beautiful works of the masters. <strong>Flaubert</strong></p></blockquote>

<hr />

<h1>From metaphysic to value theory</h1>

<p>when somebody dies - it&#8217;s hard for the rest of us.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re thinking about the central badness of death, it seems to me that we&#8217;ve got to focus on my being dead. What is it about my being dead that&#8217;s bad for me? When I dead, I&#8217;m not exist.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s bad because while you&#8217;re doing this, you&#8217;re not getting something better. Example, stay home and watch something on TV. How it could be bad for me? It&#8217;s a pleasant enought way to spend a half an hour, on the other hand, suppose what I could be doing instead of watching a half an hour of television is being at a really great party.</p>

<p>In this case the fact I stayed at home watching TV is bad for me in this comparative sense. It&#8217;s not in itself an unpleasant way to spend some time. It&#8217;s just there&#8217;s a better way to spend time that I could invest in something else. <em>Theres a lack of the better good</em></p>

<p>A lack is not intrinsically bad, but it&#8217;s still a kind of bad in this second sense. <em>To be lacking a good is itself bad for me.</em></p>

<p>So, nonexistence is bad by virtue of the opportunity costs that are involved. When I don&#8217;t exist I&#8217;m not getting the things that I could have otherwise gotten, if only I were still alive. <strong>Death is bad because it deprives me of the good things in life</strong></p>

<p>How could it be that death is bad for me when I don&#8217;t exist?</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Something can be bad for you only if you exist</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re dead you don&#8217;t exist
=> C. Death can&#8217;t be bad for you.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not then concern either the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no more. <strong>Epicurus</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Modest version</strong> A. Something can be bad for you, only if you exist at sometime or the other. (dead can be bad for me)
<strong>Bolder claim</strong> B. Something can be bad for you, only if you exist at the same time as that thing. (then bad can&#8217;t be bad for you)</p>

		<p>So the worker the more he works, the more he feels outside himself or that he has lost himself by producing something. But for Marx, when we produce things we see ourselves in what we make, we see a reflection of ourselves that increases our understanding. But in industrial world we see our own alienation, our own distance from ourselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>The worker therefore only feels himself ourside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home&#8230; Lastly, the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else&#8217;s&#8230;</p>

<p>As a result, therefore, man (the worker) only feels himself freely active in his animal functions - eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc; and in his human fuctuons he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marx means that what is truly human about us is our ability to do creative work, we plane, we create and that now (with industrialization) becomes what makes us feel like an animal, like we&#8217;re controlled by others. And we feel free when we do animal functions - eat, sleep, procreate, when we should feel most free when we work.</p>

<blockquote><p>The object of labor is, therefore, the objection of man&#8217;s speciess-life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he sees himself in a world that he has created. In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labor tears from him his species-life&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Our species-life is that we are able to see ourselves in the creative work we do.</p>

<p>Even as we work more and more, we become further and further away from who we should be or who we might become. That&#8217;s a contradiction for Marx. <strong>We&#8217;re living like animals even if we have a greater capacity to be human. That should create a synthesis, that&#8217;s the revolution for Marx.</strong></p>

<p>Dialectic can&#8217;t persist forever, because truth emerges in history, history has to resolve contradictions. Marx says, that when the worker realizes that the worker is oppressed and has to control his own labor, that liberates everyone. That show everyone that the work we do should be our own.</p>

<p>The working class for Marx is the vehicle for the resolution of historical contradictions. And when the worker class will resolve this contradtiction, all the rest of us can wake up, and we can see those contradictions resolved too.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the relationship of estranged labor to private property it follows further that the emancipation (освобождение) of society from private property, etc, from servitude, is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workes; not that their emancipation alone is at stake, but because the emacipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Bourgeosie, the middle class, a most revolutionaty class.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers. Communist Manifesto.</p>

<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggless.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s bourgeoisie reveal that it&#8217;s economic contradiction that forces people to do things they would otherwise find abhorrent (отвратительный).</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.</p>

<p>All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable (почтенный) prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify (окостеневать). All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relation with his kind.</p></blockquote>

<p>bourgeoisie shows the &#8220;real&#8221; conditions of life, and that for Marx is economic exploitation. That behind marriage is economic exploitation, behind patriarchy is economic exploitation, behind the economy, behind the government. The real conditions of life are alienation and economic exploitation, that once revealed, will make people want to change the conditions of their lives.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>About Marx and his teacher Hegel.</p>

<p>Hegel is the most important philosopher in up until his time.</p>

<blockquote><p>The only Thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of Reason; that Reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process. Hegel, Lecture on the Philosophy of History</p></blockquote>

<p>The only place where you can find the truth is in the world, in history.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reason is the substance of the Universe; viz. that by wchi and in which all reality has its being and subsistence. On the other hand, it is the Infinite Energy of the Universe&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Modernity for Hegel is the period in which we understand that the only place we should look for truth is right around us, not in some divine (божественный) or ideal realm.</p>

<blockquote><p>In traversing the past we have only to do with what is present&#8230; The life of the ever present Spitir is a circle of progressive embodiments, which looked at in one aspect still exist beside each other, and only looked at from another point of view appear as past.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dialectical processes are how the past is retained in the present.</p>

<h1>Thesis | Antithesis => Synthesis</h1>

<p>Fathers | Sons => Synthesis or opposit of it - Negation</p>

<hr />

<p>Conflict makes the world go round. History is reasonable. Truth is in the flesh of history, Hegel takes it from being the flesh of Jesus, to being the stuff of history. That&#8217;s the only realm where truth is found. So you can&#8217;t isolate youself and try to find the truth, truth is on the battlefield, in politics, on the streets, the <strong>truth will emerge in history</strong>. That is Hegel&#8217;s strong belieive.</p>

<blockquote><p>The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom; a progress whose development according to the necessity of its nature it is our business to investigate. Hegel</p>

<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Communist Manifesto</p>

<p>On the basis of political economy itself, in its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the most wretched (несчастный) of commodities; that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production&#8230; Marx</p></blockquote>

<p>That creates self-estrangement or alienation. Create more and more, but get less and less, because prices go down and that&#8217;s the problem for workers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.</p></blockquote>

<p>Through your work you see more about yourself, you learn about yourself, from the work you do. Marx says that happenes in capitalism when I make something, it&#8217;s not mine, somebody else takes it away immediately. I make something and the more I make, the more it&#8217;s somebody esle&#8217;s and so by working, I lose myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ivan Ilych&#8217;s case is very typical, most of at fundamental level don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re going to die.</p>

<p>When people have these near brushes with death, it&#8217;s easy to velieve that the fact of their mortality is more vivid. It&#8217;s something before their eye. And they after that can say, I need to change my life, I need to spent less time at the office and more time with my family, telling the people that I love them, doint the things that are important to me, spending less time to worry about getting ahead, making money, getting the plasma TV.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say when we find the fact of our mortailty is made vivid, when we change our priorites.</p>

<h2>The claim about everybody dies alone</h2>

<p>Nobody can die your death for you, nobody can take your part. It doesn&#8217;t express very clearly. But what about the cases when person die in car acident in the middle of conversation. He die very fast and seems to me in this case we can say he dies alone, it was very fast.</p>

<p>But what about Socrates? He was not lonely. Hume died, had illines, he used to talk about various matters with friends, he was cheefrul and pleasent to the end. And here is no reason at all to believe that he was feeling lonely.</p>

<h1>Is Death Bad?</h1>

<p>When I die I ceased to exists. We want to turn to ethical question about death. Why is death bad? How death can be death?</p>

<p>Value questions. How and in what ways the death is bad? Is death bad? What makes it bad?</p>

<p>John&#8217;s death is bad for John&#8217;s friends and family. When somebody dies, we lose the chance to continue interacting with a person.</p>

<p><strong>How could it be true that death is bad for the person that dies?</strong></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We don&#8217;t have P-functioning when we sleep, so should we say we dead then? Well, that&#8217;s clearly not the right thing to say.</p>

<h2>What is it to be dead?</h2>

<p>It can&#8217;t be just a matter of not <strong>P-functioning</strong>. Suppose that to be alive is to be able to engage in P-functioning.</p>

<p>Sometimes people say that we die alone or everybody dies alone. Somehow, at some level, nobody really believes they&#8217;re going to die at all. Since it&#8217;s impossible to picture being dead, nobody believes in the possibility that they&#8217;re going to die, that they&#8217;re going to cease to exist.</p>

<p>What is it like to be dead? We can&#8217;t imagine being dead. But can we imagine being cell phone or bold ball pen? No, so, there&#8217;s no mystery about what it&#8217;s like to be dead - <strong>it isn&#8217;t like anything</strong>. There is nothing there to describe. When you&#8217;re dead there&#8217;s nothing happening on the inside to be imagined.</p>

<p>From the mere fact that you can&#8217;t picture from the inside what it&#8217;s like to be dead, it doesn&#8217;t follow that nobody believes they&#8217;re going to die.</p>

<p>You can not picture it from the inside, but you can picture it from the outside. Dreamless or fainting - picture of my body lying on the bed or ground unconscious. I can picture my being dead quit easily, no functioning occuring in my body.</p>

<p>Everytime I try to picture myself being dead, I smuggle myself back in, conscious and existing as a person, hence, not dead as a person. Maybe my body (i imagining my body dead, but i&#8217;m not imagining myself, the person, dead).</p>

<p>Nobody believes they&#8217;re going to undergo bodily death?</p>

		<blockquote><p>Everything begins to change in appearance&#8230; The more they see one another, the less they can do without seeing one another still more. A tender and sweet sentiment steals into the soul, and at the least obstacle becomes an impetuous frenzy; jealousy awakens together with love; Discord triumphs, and the greatest of all passions receives sacrifices of human blood. Discourse on Inequality</p></blockquote>

<p>We begin to act for each other, we want to appear the way we want to be seen which is a departure from how we just act naturally.</p>

<blockquote><p>Everyone began to look at everyone else and to wish to be looked at himself, and public esteem acquired a value&#8230; The fermentation caused by these new leavens eventually produced <strong>compounds fatal to happiness and innocence</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>When we begin to want to appear in a certain way for the other, we begin to be fakers, we begin to be hypocrites. <strong>We begin to leave who we really were and begin to try to be something for somebody else.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We want to be someone who we are not just so we can please another.</strong> We need things like luxuries, but they don&#8217;t seem like luxuries anymore, we need those things to be who we think we are.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;since these conveniences, by becoming habitual, had almost entirely ceased to be enjoyable, and at the same time degenerated into true needs, it became much more cruel to be deprived of them than to possess them was sweet, and men were unhappy to lose them without being happy to possess them.</p></blockquote>

<p>You deisre something, and when you get it, after awhile you don&#8217;t get any pleasure from it, but if you lose it - it causes you pain. <strong>Become more vulnerable to pain</strong>. As you acquire luxuries, you become more vulnerable to pain, because the luxuries you acquire after a while you get, just get habituated to them, they become just part of your life and you don&#8217;t get pleasure from them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Although men now had less endurance, and natural pity had already undergone some modification, this period in the development of the human faculties, occupying a just mean <strong>between</strong> indolence of the primitive state and the petulant activity of our vanity, must have been the happiest and the logest-lasting epoch. &#8230; <em>the real youth of the world</em>&#8230;</p>

<p>Lacking valid resons to justify and sufficient strength to defend himself&#8230; the rich, under the pressure of necessity, at last conceived the most well-considered project ever to enter man&#8217;s mind; to use ven his atackers forces in his favor, to make his adversaries his defenders, to instill in them other maxims and to give them different institutions as favorable to himself as natural Right was contrary to him.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the rich create a scheme to get the poor to defend property.</p>

<blockquote><p>All ran toward their chains in the belief that they were securing their freedom; for while they had enought reason to sense the advantages of a political establishment, they had not enough experience to foresee its dangers.</p></blockquote>

<p>It creates a situation where the rest of society wants to emulate the rich, tries to become rich, corrupting themselves even further. So on the one hand, they suffer because they&#8217;re poor, and then they suffer in the soul becuase they think that the key to salvation is the acquisition of wealth, becoming superior to other people.</p>

<p>Rich people are so sentitive, because you can hurt, they protect their fancy castles, fancy clothes, they have so many ways in which they invested in luxuries, that they are sensitive in every part of their goods.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Natural love of freedom</h2>

<blockquote><p>Man&#8217;s natural dispositions for or against servitude must therefore not be judged by the degradation of enslaved Peoples but by the prodigious (огромный) feats (подвиги) of all free Peoples to protect themselves against oppression (угнетение).</p>

<p>Animals &#8230; born free and abhorring captivity smash their heads against the bars of their prison.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rich people are happy because of the existence of the poor. That the wealth itself doesn&#8217;t mean that much to them, but what means something to them is that they could look at other people and feel superior to them. Rich like having that much food because the other people are starving.</p>

<blockquote><p>That indeed, is the genuine cause of all these differences: the Savage lives in himself; sociable man, always outside himself, is capable of living only in the opinion of others and, so to speak, derives the sentiment of his own existence solely from their judgment.</p></blockquote>

<p>We want to be seen in a certain way by other people.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is manifestly against the Law of Nature, however defined, that a child command an old man, an imbecile lead a wise man, and a handful of people abound in superfluities while the starving multitude lacks in necessities.</p>

<p>Voltaire writes: I have received, sir, your new book agains the human species, and I thank you for it&#8230; No one has ever been so witty as you are in trying to turn us into brutes: to read your book makes one long to go on all fours. Since, however, it is now some sixty years since I gave up the practice, I feel it is unfortunately imposible for me to resume it: I leave this natural habit to those more fit for it than are you and I.</p></blockquote>

		<h1>Discourse on the Origins of Inequality</h1>

<blockquote><p>For all the rest of the day, wandering deep into the forest, I sought and I found the vision of those primitive times, the history of which I proudly traced. I demolished the petty lies of mankind; I dared strip man&#8217;s nature naked, to follow the progress of time, and trace the things which have distorted it; and by comparing man as he has made himself with man as he is by nature, I showed him in his pretended perfection (&#8220;progress&#8221;) the true source of his misery.</p>

<p>Exalted by these sublime meditations my soul soared towards Divinity, from whose height I looked down on my fellow men pursuing the blind path of their prejudices, of their errors, of their misfortunes and their crimes. Then I cried to them in a voice which they could not hear, &#8220;Madmen who ceaselessly complain of Nature, learn that all your misfortunes arise from yourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is, I sense, an age at which the individual human being would want to stop; you will seek the age at which you would wish your Spicies had stopped.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Two principles prior to reason:</h2>

<ol>
<li>interest in self-preservation (hide, get away, keep alive)</li>
<li>is the natural repugnance at seeing another sentient being suffer.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Whereas in this primitive state&#8230; everyone bedded down at random and often for only a single night; males and females united fortuitously, according to chance encounters, opportunity and desire, without speech being an especially necessary interpreter of what they had to tell one another; they parted just as readily.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are not measuring yourself against another, you are off to the next encounter. Only when you are in society when people start looking at each other, trying to be someone else for another, act for another, only in such situation will inequality really begin to increase in dynamic fashion.</p>

<blockquote><p>It will be evident how much smaller the difference between man and man must be in the state of Nature than in the state of society, and how much natural inequality in the human species must increase as a result of instituted inequality.</p>

<p>The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, to who, it occurred to say <em>this is mine</em> and found people sufficiently simple to believe him, was the true founder of civil society.</p></blockquote>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/08/05/august-5-tuesday/">[Modern Art] 2. What Is Enlightenment // [Death] 13. Personal Identity</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>What is Enlightenment?</h1>

<p>Rousseau wrote about being stirred (перемешивать) by his passions and he stirred passions of others. He is the conscience of the enlightenment, bad <strong>conscience of the enlightenment. He rejects it.</strong> <em>He participates in the enlightenment and he turns against it.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>One day I took the Mercure de France (newspaper), and galncing throught it as I walked, I came upon this question propounded by the Dijon Academy for the next year&#8217;s prize, &#8221;<strong>Has the progress of sciences and arts done more to corrupt morals, or to improve them?</strong>&#8221; The moment I read this, I beheld another universe and became an other man. <strong>Confessions</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1>Discourse - The Arts and Sciences</h1>

<p>Have the arts and science contributed to morals? Rousseau expected people will talk about it in the way about improving and making the world better, as we&#8217;ve said that&#8217;s what enlightenment is. What could be bad? And Rousseau says quite the opposite:</p>

<blockquote><p>While the Government and the Laws see to the safety and the well being of men assembled, the Sciences, Letters and Arts, less despotic and perhaps more powerful, spread garlands of flowers over the iron chains with which they are laden, throttle in them the sentiment of that original freedom for which they seemed born, make them love their slavery, and fashion them into what is called civilized peoples.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The arts and science cover up our oppressions. They make us forget that we&#8217;re not free, even worse, they make us love our slavery. They don&#8217;t promote knowledge and understanding, they promote tyranny and inequality.</strong></p>

<p>The arts and sciences create new form of needs, <strong>new forms of dependence</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Princes] know that all needs which a People imposes on itself are so many chains which it assumes&#8230; Indeed what yoke could be imposed on men who need nothing?</p></blockquote>

<p>The arts and sciences become luxuries, they promote in us new forms of dependence. We don&#8217;t need them to begin with, but once we have the Arts and Science, then they are deprived of them at some point, we feel pain, we feel we&#8217;re missing something.</p>

<p>For Rousseua this was as creating new forms of dependences, vulnerability is a form of degradation and corruption, not progress.</p>

<blockquote><p>What conclusion is to be drawn from this paradox so worthy of being born in our time; and what will become of virtue when one hat to get richt at all cost? The ancient political thinkers forever spoke of morals and of virtuel ours pseak only of commerce and money.</p></blockquote>

<p>In those good od days we were simpler, we were content to be more honest with one another.</p>

<h2>relationship of learning and luxury:</h2>

<blockquote><p>What gives rise to all of these abuses, if not the fatal inequality introduced among men by the distinction of talents and the disparagement of the virtues? This is the most obvios effect of all our studies, and the most dangerous in its consequences.</p></blockquote>

<p>You get some people who seem to be really smart and other people who aren&#8217;t so smart. You begin to get <strong>some people who look up to the writer, the pholosopher, the scientist</strong> and <strong>say, oh, I wish I could be like that</strong>. <strong>At this moment you have introduced a whole form of corruption.</strong></p>

<p>That it&#8217;s going to be a slippery slope for human beings because they will try to be someone they are not and <strong>for Rousseau that is a form of dishonesty.</strong></p>

<p>Writes get into this more all the time, scientists, thinkers get into this mode, they are perfoming for someone else, they are creating luxuries, introducing inequality and <strong>under the guise</strong> (облик) of <strong>promoting knowledge</strong> they are promoting a kind of <strong>dishonesty</strong>, we might call today <strong>inauthenticity</strong> (недостоверность).</p>

<p>Slippery slope of modernity. We&#8217;re getting further and further away from who we naturally should be, who are by nature.</p>

<p>But, in the end of discorse we see a little surprise after those previous radical talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let learned men of the first rank find honorable asylum in their courts. Let them there receive the only reward worthy of them; by the credit they enjoy, to contribute to the happiness of the People to whom they have taught wisdom.
* he&#8217;s just told us why inequality is so bad, slippery slope of enlightment. what he says is the cure? To give th esmart people power. Why is that? Because we can&#8217;t go backward, can&#8217;t strip off our enlightenment and go backwards. This is the diasese, the cure is to use learned men, to try to institute political change.</p></blockquote>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Nutrition Digestion and Absorption</h1>

<p>Gastrointestinal tract is responsible for receiving food:</p>

<ul>
<li>receives food: takes food from mouth</li>
<li>separates nutrients from foods: releasing them in stomach</li>
<li>transports nutrients via blood: microvilli in small intestine transfer nutrients into portal blood</li>
<li>excretes indigestible waste: fecal waste</li>
</ul>


<h1>Digestive system</h1>

<ul>
<li>mouth</li>
<li>pharynx</li>
<li>salivary glands</li>
<li>esophagus</li>
<li>liver (bile is made. bile is important in helping to digest and absorb fat)</li>
<li>stomach (secrete (выделяют) acids and protein-digesting enzimes)</li>
<li>pancreas (releases a number of different hormones and bicarbonate. Bicarbonate is to help neutralize the intestinal contents, neytralizing acid content, also produces enzymes that digest carbohydrate, protein, and fat.)</li>
<li>gallbladder (stores bile, and then relases it into the small intestine when it&#8217;s needed)</li>
<li>small intestine (responsible for absorbing nutrients into the blood or the lymph. most of the nutritions absobed)</li>
<li>large intestine (water and vitamines and minerals absorbed. it&#8217;s home to bacteria that help ferment some of the fibers that you eat)</li>
<li>anus (waste)</li>
</ul>


<h1>The Stomach</h1>

<p>Esophagus -> Lower esophageal sphincter -> Fundus -> Pyloric sphincter</p>

<p>Spincter helps to keep acid inside the stomach. Primarty nutrients absorbed - water, alcohol, minerals. Highly acidic enviroment and it secretes a lot of gastric juices:</p>

<ul>
<li>hydrochloric acid (denatures protein and activate pepsin)</li>
<li>pepsin (enzume that digest protein)</li>
<li>gastric lipase (enzume that digest fat)</li>
<li>mucus ( protects stomach lining)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Small Intestine</h1>

<ul>
<li>main site for digestion and absorption</li>
<li>chyme moved by peristalsis and mixed by rhythmic constractions called segmentation</li>
<li>20 feet long</li>
<li>undigested pass from small to large intestine through a sphinchter</li>
</ul>


<h2>Parts of the small intestine:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Duodenum: minerals (calcium, phsphorus, magnesium, iron, copper) and vitamins (thamin, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, folate, A,D,E,K)</li>
<li>Jejunum: minerals (calcuymm phowphous, magnesium, iron, zinc, chromium, mangenese, molybdenum) vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenate, biotin, folate, B6, C, A,D,E,K; lipids; carbohydrates: monosaccharides; protins: amino acids and small peptides</li>
<li>Ileum: minerals (magnesium), vitamin C, B12, D, K, folate, bile salts and acids</li>
</ul>


<h1>The large intestine</h1>

<ul>
<li>made up of the colon and rectum</li>
<li>5 feet long</li>
<li>water, some vitamins and minerals are absorbed here</li>
<li>intestinal microflora break down fiber, synthesize small amount of B vitamins, K vitamin</li>
<li>from colon, contents pass to rectum where stored untill excreted via anus</li>
</ul>


<h1>FODMAPS approch</h1>

<p>FODMAPS - food-based approach to controlling some of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Compounds produce gas-producing osmotic effects;</p>

<h2>FODMAPS in foods:</h2>

<ul>
<li>food where fructose > glucose (honey, apples, pears, mango, watermelon, corn syrup)</li>
<li>frucrans (wheat, rye onion, garlic, artichokes, asparagus, beetroot, leek)</li>
<li>galactans (cabbage, legumes)</li>
<li>lactose (milk)</li>
<li>polyols (sorbitol and mannitol in stone fruits, prines, mushrooms, lychee)</li>
</ul>
