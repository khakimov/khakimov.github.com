		<p><strong>The legend of Peugeot company</strong> What is it? Maybe you can say it is cars that Peugeot manufactories, but it seems wrong because Peugeot company is not the same as the Peugeot cars. Maybe you can say it is factories and showrooms, but it is not. So perhaps Peugeot is the people who work in the factories and in the offices? It&#8217;s clearly not true. Peugeot is a story, it is a fiction, something that we invented, it belongs to a particular kind of fictions which is called limited liability companies.</p>

<p>Hoc est corpus meum. (this is my body)</p>

<p>How to convince millions of people, strangers to one another to believe the same stories about gods or about limited liability companies or about nations or about human rights? It helps sapiens to manage millions of strangers to cooperate towards common goals.</p>

<p><strong>Imagined reality</strong> is something that everybody believes in and as long as this common belief persists, the imagined reality is a real force in the world.</p>

<p>Dual reality - on the on hand there is the objective reality of revirs and trees and lions, on the other hand there is the imagined reality of gods and nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became more and more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers and trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as goods and nations and corporations.</p>

<h1>Charles Darwin</h1>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s difficult to believe in the dreadful but quiet war lurking just below the serene facade of nature. Charles Darwin, 1839</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Utilitarianism</strong> it&#8217;s the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong&#8230;</p>

<p>Romanticism versus Utalitarianism. For romantics we make the world as we live in it.</p>

<p>Joshua Mill said that romanticism saved him. Joshua Mill was a prodigy child, he learned Greek by the age of three, high level mathematics by four or five, various languages and then he had a nervous breakdown, he has crisis.</p>

<p>You can do what you want as long as it doesn&#8217;t hurt someone else. This notion of liberty is key for modern political thought</p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose that all your objects in life were realized&#8230; would this be a joy and happiness to you? And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered &#8220;No!&#8221; At this my heart sank within me; the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down. John Stuart Mill, Autobiography</p></blockquote>

<p>And then he read about melancholy and dejection, and he says, these people know about life. They don&#8217;t say oh, you should flip a coin or go and take a class. These people actually explore their experience of sadness as a way of deepening their lives and creating art. And Mill wanted to create a bridge between utilitarianism and this romanticism. And the rest of his life he focused on building a philosophy that combines attention to utility, attention to calculation, but also attention to organic community, attention to the whole.</p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s problem. Why is there variety? Species are not permanent. Darwin went to investigate nature, he says, I&#8217;ve got to look, and I&#8217;ve got to collect. He went on famous voyage on the ship Beagles, from 1831 to 1836.</p>

<blockquote><p>This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a flucuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic. On the Origin of Species</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Origin of Species</strong> is published in 1859.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Fear of Death</h1>

<p>In what circumstances, or in what ways, should we behave one way rather than another? Kafka, for example, said the meaning of life is the fact that it ends. Cryptic, as usually for Kafka, but suggestion, is a fairly common one, it&#8217;s something deep about how we should live, that we&#8217;re going to die, that our life will come to an end. How should we respond to that fact?</p>

<p>Emotional response. Fear. Terror of death. Is fear of death a rationally appropriate response? resonable emotion?</p>

<p>Under what conditions does it make sense to be proud of something? First of all, the thing that you&#8217;re proud of has to be some kind of accomplishment. Something that it makes sense for you to be proud of it, it&#8217;s got to be in some way an accomplishment that reflects well on you.</p>

<p>Conditions number <strong>one</strong> - in order to feel <strong>fear</strong> it has to <strong>be bad</strong>. Fear requires something bad, as the object of your fear. Conditions number <strong>two</strong> - there&#8217;s should be nonnegligible chance of the bad state of affairs happening, <strong>of the bad object coming to you</strong>. Fear by mauled to death by tigers doesn&#8217;t make any sense.
Conditions number three - we need to have a cerain amount of uncertainty in order to have fear be appropriate. Where the bad thing will occur and/or how bad the bad thing will be.</p>

<p>First thing you might worry about the death is the process of dying. Then afraid just being dead, but it&#8217;s not appropriate in that case because you&#8217;re guaranteed that you&#8217;re going to die and this is not nonegligible chance. Is being dead intrinsically a bad thing? It doesn&#8217;t seem to me that it is. The only thing you could be afraid of is that you might die too soon, earlier rather than later.</p>

<p>Maybe <strong>anger</strong> is appropriate response? Anger itself has appropriateness conditions. In order for anger to make sense, well, here&#8217;s condition that make sense.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s got to be directed at a person. It has control over whatever he/she doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Anger makes sense only when the agent has wronged you, has treated you in a way that it was morally inappropriate in a way to treat you. If your rommate has been doing things that you don&#8217;t like, but they haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, anger doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe I should just be sad at the fact that I&#8217;m going to die to soon and some emotions does make sense. The world&#8217;s a wonderful place and it would be better to have more of it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s extraordinarily lucky of us to be in this select, fortunate few. Not fear, not anger, we need to be gradidute to be alive at all.</p>

<p>Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s book - Cat&#8217;s Cradle</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you did know how much time left to live, how would you act differently from what you&#8217;re doing now? Would it focus your attention on making sure you did the things that were most important to you?</p>

<p>To find the most valuable thing in life ask the question what would you choose to do if you knew you had five years, ten years, what have you?</p>

<p>The possibility of death is ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Examples about values in the life. My two favorite foods in the world are probably pizza on the one hand and chocolate on the other. If you combaine it into pizza with chocolate top just sounds disgusting. But it&#8217;s not bad if you think about pizza in isolation and chocolate in isolation. So, same concept to think about death following the life.</p>

<p>Negative <strong>Taste is just a tease and how the noble have fallen</strong> on the one hand.</p>

<p>Positive <strong>the extra preciousness of life</strong></p>

<p><strong>Should we be thinking about death at all?</strong> The appropriate way to live gets shaped, at least in part, by the fact that we&#8217;re going to die, that we won&#8217;t be around forever.</p>

<p>The facts about death, if I thought about them, would change my begavior, but not because it would give me a reason to change my behavior - simply because it would influence my behavior. So, better to not think about them (not think about death)</p>

<p>To have talent, you must be convinced that you possess it; and to keep your conscience pure you must set it above everybody else&#8217;s. The way to live serenely, in clean, fresh air, is to install youself on some pyramid, no matter which, provided it be lofty and have a solid foundation. Ah! It isn&#8217;t always &#8216;amusing&#8217; up there, and you are absolutely alone; but there is some consalation in spitting from so high a place.</p></blockquote>

<p>The realy real for Flaubert is art.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the best form in which to express on&#8217;s opinion&#8230; about the affairs of this world without risking being taken later for a fool? It&#8217;s a difficult problem.

		<p>When people think they are going beyond the common place, that&#8217;s the time to really be suspicious. Romantism rejected mechanistic approach to happines or to pleasure. <strong>The Romantics</strong> value emotions, they value conflict, interested in nature as a scene of turbulence, they value authenticity, a kind of deep honesty and an expression of the soul and the arts, very importantly. Flaubert understands romanticism inside out, but he rejects it. He thinks it leads to <strong>stupidity and cliche</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Those who were beginning to age had a youthful look, while a touch of maturity overlay the faces of the younger. In their indiferent gazes floated the tranquility of passions daily gratified, and beneath their gentle manners was visible that particular brutality imparted by domination in rather easy things, in which one&#8217;s strength is exerted and one&#8217;s vanity tickled - the handling of thoroughbred hourses and the company of fallen women.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>How good is your life? Add up your experiences and your accomplishments and the particular details of your life as what the story is about. Being alive per se it has no value. Life itself is a container which we fill with various goods or bads. And deciding how valuable it is, how good it is for me to be alive is a matter of adding up the value of the contents of the life. <strong>But the container itself is a mere container. It has no value in and of itself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Neutrual container theory</strong> - only about pain and pleasure, mere container is a neutral.</p>

<p><strong>Valuable container theory</strong> - Life itself is worth having. There&#8217;s benefit to me above and beyond the question of what&#8217;s going on within my life (am I loved, am I accomplishing things, am I having nice experiences or not) but we need to remember mere fact that I&#8217;m alive gives my life some value.</p>

<p>How much extra add valueble container? Modest versions of the valuable container theory say, although being alive per se is good, if the contents of your life get bad enought, that <strong>can outweigh the value of being alive</strong> so that the grand total is negative.</p>

<p>Against it thinks being alive per se is so incredibly valuable that no matter how horrible the contents are, the <strong>grand total will always be positive</strong>. (fantastic valuable container theory)</p>

<p>The centrual bad thing about to die is the fact that because I&#8217;ll be dead I&#8217;ll be deprived of the good things in life. This is not the only bad thing, there are other features of death, as we experience it, that are separable from the deprivation account.</p>

<p>If we see it can not go any other way we don&#8217;t have to feel bad about it. 2 + 2 always equal 4. Spinoza.</p>

<p>would it be better to know when you were going to die? Because of unpredictability it&#8217;s difficult to make right kinds of plans. And in particular, it&#8217;s hard to know how to pace youself. It can work the other way as well, you make a life plan and then you don&#8217;t die yet, you continue to stick around and then your life has this feeling anticlimitic.</p>

<p>The overall shape of you life matters (the narrative arc of your life)</p>

<hr />

<h1>The Value of Life</h1>

<p>Example with rat and orgasmic impulse, when they stop eat and having sex except but clicking button with this impulses. Why we could not imagine doing same thing with us? <strong>There&#8217;s something that distinguishes humans from rats.</strong> No doubt you would enjoy it for a very long time. But I imagine that after a period, part of you is going to start asking, &#8220;Huh, say, it feels the same as it was yesterday and the day before that and the day before that.&#8221; I imagine this is how it&#8217;s going to feel tomorrow, and the day after that and the day after that. And eventually this question would start, <strong>&#8220;is this really all there is to life, just simple pleasure like this?&#8221;</strong> You are not just going to stay caught in the moment. You&#8217;re going to take this meta-level or higher level standpoint, look down at the pleasure and wonder, &#8220;Is this all that there is to life?&#8221; and this question will override the pleasure, <strong>eventually, you&#8217;d become hirrified that you were, in effect, stuck in this rat-like existence.</strong></p>

<p>Immortality can&#8217;t be something desirable, it would be a nightmare, something you would long to free yourself from.</p>

<p>So parhaps the best form of life would be not immortality; and not what we&#8217;ve got now, where you live after a mere drop of 50 or 80 or 100 years. But rather the best thing I suppose would be to be able to live as long as you wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Is it worth continuing to live or is it not wort continuing to live?</strong></p>

<p>good life vs bad life?</p>

<p>The things that are worth having for their own sake, philosophers call <strong>intrinsically valuable</strong>. Instrumentally good or bad things in the list about good vs bad life.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s worth having for its own sake?</strong> Well, one natural suggestion is that pleasure (intrinsically good) is worth having for its own sake and pain (intrinsically bad) is probably worth avoiding for its own sake.</p>

<p>Hedonism is a view that many people are attracted to, it&#8217;s got a very simple theory of the nature of wellbeing. Being well of is a matter of experiencing pleasure and avoiding or minimizing the expirience of pain.</p>

<p>In deciding whether what life holds for you is worth having, better than nothing, you, roughly speaking, add up all the good times and substract all the bad times and see whether the net balance is positive or negative.</p>

<p><strong>Add up all the pleasures, subtract all the pains.</strong></p>

<p>If only I had chosen to become a doctor, instead of having chosen to become a lawyer. How much better off or worse off would I have been? Or if I decide to become an artice or a scholar or a beach bum or a farmer, how much better off or worse off would I have been? You&#8217;re trying to project your future and asking the question &#8220;Where do I think I&#8217;d be better off?&#8221;, which of these branches that are available to me, the branches of my life story which is the one in which the future from here on our holds more pleasure and holds less pain. That&#8217;s how hedonist will think about choises.</p>

<p>We can evaluate this year, or 6 month, or just this evening. I can talk about, well, what should I do tonight? Shoild I stay home and work on my paper? Should I go to the party? Where will I be better off tonight?</p>

<p>We do our evaluation not for the entire lives, but of chunk of lives. That what we can do if we&#8217;re accept hedonism. <strong>Should we accept hedonism?</strong></p>

<p>Robert Nozick, a philosopher who died a few years ago. Nizick invited us to imagine an experience machine, that&#8217;s offer us not just simple rat-machine with impulses to generate pleasure in our brain, he offers, basically, completely realistic virtual reality. When you are hooked up to the machine, it seems to you exactly the same on the inside as it would seem to you if you really were.</p>

<p>You coud have the identical experience of climbing Mount Everest, you&#8217;d feel the wind bracing you. You feel the thrill of having made it to the top and the wind bracingly striking your chin and you feel the satisfaction and you&#8217;ve got the memories of having almost died. Or <strong>write the great american novel</strong> then you&#8217;ve got the experience of staying up late at night not knowing how to make the plot work out, crushing pieces of paper and throwing them away. Or you want to be <strong>finding the cure for cancer</strong>. So you&#8217;ve got exactrly the experience you would have if you were working in your lab having the brilliant breakthrough when you finally realize what the combination is that would make the right antibody. That&#8217;s life on the experience machine. You&#8217;re not doing any of it, you just floating in the lab. But the experience are <strong>identical</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, ask youself then, would you want to spend your life hooked up to the experience machine? How would you feel if you discovered now that you have been living your life hooked up to an experience machine? <strong>Is it the best possible form of human existence?</strong></p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/08/16/august-16-friday/">[Death] 18. The Badness of Death, Part III</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lucretious says, look, most of us are upset and anxious at the fact that we&#8217;re going to die. We think death is bad for us. There&#8217;ll be this period after my death in which I won&#8217;t exist. And deprivation account helps us to say why it&#8217;s bad, because during this period of nonexistence, you&#8217;re not enjoying the good things in life. But wait a minute, <em>the period after you die isn&#8217;t the only period during which you don&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s not the only period in which if only you were still alive, you could still be enjoying the good things in life. There&#8217;s another period of nonexistence.</em> <strong>It&#8217;s the period before my birth</strong></p>

<p>It is bad? Lucretius says that&#8217;s silly, nobody upset about the fact that there was an eternity before they were born.</p>

<p>Before born you don&#8217;t life, but with death you lost it. So, we can say, that we care about that part after death more than the one before birth. <strong>Because the one after death involves loss, and the one before birth does not.</strong></p>

<p>We imaging to living the longer life. But what is it that happens when I say, if only I&#8217;d been born earlier? Well, says <strong>Feldman</strong>, you don&#8217;t actually imagine a longer life, you just shift the entire life and start it earlier. When we imaging being born earlier we don&#8217;t imaging having longer life. Nothing better about having a life earlier, according to the deprivation account.</p>

<p>So, Feldman says, no wonder, no surprise that you care about the nonexistence after death. Because when you imagine that being different, you imagine a longer life. But when you start thinking about the nonexistence before birth and you imagine that being different, you don&#8217;t imagine more goods in life, you just imagine them taking place at a different time.</p>

<p>Derek Parfit says, it&#8217;s true that when I think about the nonexistence after I die that&#8217;s loss, whereas the nonexistence before I&#8217;m born, that&#8217;s not loss, that&#8217;s mere &#8220;schmoss&#8221;. And it&#8217;s true that we need an explanation about why loss is worse than &#8220;schmoss&#8221;. But we can see that this is not an arbitrary preference on our part, because in fact, it&#8217;s part of a quite general pattern we have of caring about the future in a way that we don&#8217;t care about the past. <strong>This is a very deep fact about human caring. We are oriented towards the future and concerned about what happens in it, in a way that we&#8217;re not oriented and concerned about what happened in the past.</strong></p>

<p>Parfit&#8217;e got a very nice example, imagine that you&#8217;ve got some condition, some sort of medical condition that will kill you unless you have an operation. So fair enought, you&#8217;re going to have the operation. This will allow you to live your life. Unfortunately in order to perfom the operation, they can&#8217;t have you anesthetized. You have to be awayke, perhaps in order to tell the surgeon &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s where it hurts,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a very painful operation. Only one thing we can do is this: give a super local medication and you will not remember anything about the operation itself (24 hours completely wiped out). So you&#8217;re in the hospital and you wake up and you ask yourself, &#8220;Huh, have I had the operation yet or not?&#8221; Don&#8217;t know, right? So you ask the nurse, &#8220;Have I had the operation yet or not?&#8221; She says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, we have a couple on the hall today who are some of whom have had it and some of whom are scheduled to have it later today. Let me go look at your file, I&#8217;ll come back and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221; I want it to be the case that I&#8217;m one of the people who&#8217;s already had the operation. I don&#8217;t want to be one of the people who hasn&#8217;t yet had the operation. <strong>We want the pain to be in the past.</strong> We care more about what&#8217;s happening in the futer than we care about what&#8217;s happening in the past.</p>

		<h1>Revolution</h1>

<blockquote><p>In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. Communist Manifesto</p></blockquote>

<p>1848 - 1852 what Marx experiences is a period of great disillusion.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.</p>

<p>The present generation is like the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It now only has a new world to conquer, it must go under in order to make room for the men who are able to cope with a new world. The Class Struggles in France</p></blockquote>

<p>Febraury revolution most the beautiful revolution, it was when everybody was the brother and sisters were all fighting for the same cause. But later on in June of 1848 you get the ugly revoltion. The workers are in the streets of Paris, saying, we want jobs, we want food, we want wages, will allowe us to live well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called June Day.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Febraury revolution was the beautiful revolution, the revolution of universal sympathy, because the contradictions which erupted in it against the monarchy were still undeveloped and peacefully dormant, because the social struggle which formed their background had only achieved an ephemeral existence, and existence in phrases, in words. The June revoulution is the ugly revolution, the nasty revolution, because the phrases have given place to the real thing&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>The <strong>realy real</strong> for Marx is class strugle. After the revolution 1848 the realy real become <strong>economic law</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>What taste! What cuisine! What wines! And what speeches! Nothing could make me more scornful of success, considering the price at which it is purchased. I sat unmoved, nauseated by the patriotic fervor they whipped up with mealy platitudes such as &#8216;the abyss toward which we are running&#8217; the &#8216;honor of our flag,&#8217; the &#8216;shadow cast by our standards,&#8217; the &#8216;fraternity of peoples.&#8217; Never will there be a quarter as many ovations for the most beautiful works of the masters. <strong>Flaubert</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1>From metaphysic to value theory</h1>

<p>when somebody dies - it&#8217;s hard for the rest of us.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re thinking about the central badness of death, it seems to me that we&#8217;ve got to focus on my being dead. What is it about my being dead that&#8217;s bad for me? When I dead, I&#8217;m not exist.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s bad because while you&#8217;re doing this, you&#8217;re not getting something better. Example, stay home and watch something on TV. How it could be bad for me? It&#8217;s a pleasant enought way to spend a half an hour, on the other hand, suppose what I could be doing instead of watching a half an hour of television is being at a really great party.</p>

<p>In this case the fact I stayed at home watching TV is bad for me in this comparative sense. It&#8217;s not in itself an unpleasant way to spend some time. It&#8217;s just there&#8217;s a better way to spend time that I could invest in something else. <em>Theres a lack of the better good</em></p>

<p>A lack is not intrinsically bad, but it&#8217;s still a kind of bad in this second sense. <em>To be lacking a good is itself bad for me.</em></p>

<p>So, nonexistence is bad by virtue of the opportunity costs that are involved. When I don&#8217;t exist I&#8217;m not getting the things that I could have otherwise gotten, if only I were still alive. <strong>Death is bad because it deprives me of the good things in life</strong></p>

<p>How could it be that death is bad for me when I don&#8217;t exist?</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Something can be bad for you only if you exist</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re dead you don&#8217;t exist
=> C. Death can&#8217;t be bad for you.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not then concern either the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no more. <strong>Epicurus</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Modest version</strong> A. Something can be bad for you, only if you exist at sometime or the other. (dead can be bad for me)
<strong>Bolder claim</strong> B. Something can be bad for you, only if you exist at the same time as that thing. (then bad can&#8217;t be bad for you)</p>

		<p>So the worker the more he works, the more he feels outside himself or that he has lost himself by producing something. But for Marx, when we produce things we see ourselves in what we make, we see a reflection of ourselves that increases our understanding. But in industrial world we see our own alienation, our own distance from ourselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>The worker therefore only feels himself ourside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home&#8230; Lastly, the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else&#8217;s&#8230;</p>

<p>As a result, therefore, man (the worker) only feels himself freely active in his animal functions - eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc; and in his human fuctuons he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marx means that what is truly human about us is our ability to do creative work, we plane, we create and that now (with industrialization) becomes what makes us feel like an animal, like we&#8217;re controlled by others. And we feel free when we do animal functions - eat, sleep, procreate, when we should feel most free when we work.</p>

<blockquote><p>The object of labor is, therefore, the objection of man&#8217;s speciess-life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he sees himself in a world that he has created. In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labor tears from him his species-life&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Our species-life is that we are able to see ourselves in the creative work we do.</p>

<p>Even as we work more and more, we become further and further away from who we should be or who we might become. That&#8217;s a contradiction for Marx. <strong>We&#8217;re living like animals even if we have a greater capacity to be human. That should create a synthesis, that&#8217;s the revolution for Marx.</strong></p>

<p>Dialectic can&#8217;t persist forever, because truth emerges in history, history has to resolve contradictions. Marx says, that when the worker realizes that the worker is oppressed and has to control his own labor, that liberates everyone. That show everyone that the work we do should be our own.</p>

<p>The working class for Marx is the vehicle for the resolution of historical contradictions. And when the worker class will resolve this contradtiction, all the rest of us can wake up, and we can see those contradictions resolved too.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the relationship of estranged labor to private property it follows further that the emancipation (освобождение) of society from private property, etc, from servitude, is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workes; not that their emancipation alone is at stake, but because the emacipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Bourgeosie, the middle class, a most revolutionaty class.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers. Communist Manifesto.</p>

<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggless.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s bourgeoisie reveal that it&#8217;s economic contradiction that forces people to do things they would otherwise find abhorrent (отвратительный).</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.</p>

<p>All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable (почтенный) prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify (окостеневать). All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relation with his kind.</p></blockquote>

<p>bourgeoisie shows the &#8220;real&#8221; conditions of life, and that for Marx is economic exploitation. That behind marriage is economic exploitation, behind patriarchy is economic exploitation, behind the economy, behind the government. The real conditions of life are alienation and economic exploitation, that once revealed, will make people want to change the conditions of their lives.</p>

		<p>About Marx and his teacher Hegel.</p>

<p>Hegel is the most important philosopher in up until his time.</p>

<blockquote><p>The only Thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of Reason; that Reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process. Hegel, Lecture on the Philosophy of History</p></blockquote>

<p>The only place where you can find the truth is in the world, in history.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reason is the substance of the Universe; viz. that by wchi and in which all reality has its being and subsistence. On the other hand, it is the Infinite Energy of the Universe&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Modernity for Hegel is the period in which we understand that the only place we should look for truth is right around us, not in some divine (божественный) or ideal realm.</p>

<blockquote><p>In traversing the past we have only to do with what is present&#8230; The life of the ever present Spitir is a circle of progressive embodiments, which looked at in one aspect still exist beside each other, and only looked at from another point of view appear as past.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dialectical processes are how the past is retained in the present.</p>

<h1>Thesis | Antithesis => Synthesis</h1>

<p>Fathers | Sons => Synthesis or opposit of it - Negation</p>

<hr />

<p>Conflict makes the world go round. History is reasonable. Truth is in the flesh of history, Hegel takes it from being the flesh of Jesus, to being the stuff of history. That&#8217;s the only realm where truth is found. So you can&#8217;t isolate youself and try to find the truth, truth is on the battlefield, in politics, on the streets, the <strong>truth will emerge in history</strong>. That is Hegel&#8217;s strong belieive.</p>

<blockquote><p>The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom; a progress whose development according to the necessity of its nature it is our business to investigate. Hegel</p>

<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Communist Manifesto</p>

<p>On the basis of political economy itself, in its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the most wretched (несчастный) of commodities; that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production&#8230; Marx</p></blockquote>

<p>That creates self-estrangement or alienation. Create more and more, but get less and less, because prices go down and that&#8217;s the problem for workers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.</p></blockquote>

<p>Through your work you see more about yourself, you learn about yourself, from the work you do. Marx says that happenes in capitalism when I make something, it&#8217;s not mine, somebody else takes it away immediately. I make something and the more I make, the more it&#8217;s somebody esle&#8217;s and so by working, I lose myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ivan Ilych&#8217;s case is very typical, most of at fundamental level don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re going to die.</p>

<p>When people have these near brushes with death, it&#8217;s easy to velieve that the fact of their mortality is more vivid. It&#8217;s something before their eye. And they after that can say, I need to change my life, I need to spent less time at the office and more time with my family, telling the people that I love them, doint the things that are important to me, spending less time to worry about getting ahead, making money, getting the plasma TV.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say when we find the fact of our mortailty is made vivid, when we change our priorites.</p>

<h2>The claim about everybody dies alone</h2>

<p>Nobody can die your death for you, nobody can take your part. It doesn&#8217;t express very clearly. But what about the cases when person die in car acident in the middle of conversation. He die very fast and seems to me in this case we can say he dies alone, it was very fast.</p>

<p>But what about Socrates? He was not lonely. Hume died, had illines, he used to talk about various matters with friends, he was cheefrul and pleasent to the end. And here is no reason at all to believe that he was feeling lonely.</p>

<h1>Is Death Bad?</h1>

<p>When I die I ceased to exists. We want to turn to ethical question about death. Why is death bad? How death can be death?</p>

<p>Value questions. How and in what ways the death is bad? Is death bad? What makes it bad?</p>

<p>John&#8217;s death is bad for John&#8217;s friends and family. When somebody dies, we lose the chance to continue interacting with a person.</p>

<p><strong>How could it be true that death is bad for the person that dies?</strong></p>
