	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/08/05/august-5-tuesday/">[Modern Art] 2. What Is Enlightenment // [Death] 13. Personal Identity</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>What is Enlightenment?</h1>

<p>Rousseau wrote about being stirred (перемешивать) by his passions and he stirred passions of others. He is the conscience of the enlightenment, bad <strong>conscience of the enlightenment. He rejects it.</strong> <em>He participates in the enlightenment and he turns against it.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>One day I took the Mercure de France (newspaper), and galncing throught it as I walked, I came upon this question propounded by the Dijon Academy for the next year&#8217;s prize, &#8221;<strong>Has the progress of sciences and arts done more to corrupt morals, or to improve them?</strong>&#8221; The moment I read this, I beheld another universe and became an other man. <strong>Confessions</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1>Discourse - The Arts and Sciences</h1>

<p>Have the arts and science contributed to morals? Rousseau expected people will talk about it in the way about improving and making the world better, as we&#8217;ve said that&#8217;s what enlightenment is. What could be bad? And Rousseau says quite the opposite:</p>

<blockquote><p>While the Government and the Laws see to the safety and the well being of men assembled, the Sciences, Letters and Arts, less despotic and perhaps more powerful, spread garlands of flowers over the iron chains with which they are laden, throttle in them the sentiment of that original freedom for which they seemed born, make them love their slavery, and fashion them into what is called civilized peoples.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The arts and science cover up our oppressions. They make us forget that we&#8217;re not free, even worse, they make us love our slavery. They don&#8217;t promote knowledge and understanding, they promote tyranny and inequality.</strong></p>

<p>The arts and sciences create new form of needs, <strong>new forms of dependence</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Princes] know that all needs which a People imposes on itself are so many chains which it assumes&#8230; Indeed what yoke could be imposed on men who need nothing?</p></blockquote>

<p>The arts and sciences become luxuries, they promote in us new forms of dependence. We don&#8217;t need them to begin with, but once we have the Arts and Science, then they are deprived of them at some point, we feel pain, we feel we&#8217;re missing something.</p>

<p>For Rousseua this was as creating new forms of dependences, vulnerability is a form of degradation and corruption, not progress.</p>

<blockquote><p>What conclusion is to be drawn from this paradox so worthy of being born in our time; and what will become of virtue when one hat to get richt at all cost? The ancient political thinkers forever spoke of morals and of virtuel ours pseak only of commerce and money.</p></blockquote>

<p>In those good od days we were simpler, we were content to be more honest with one another.</p>

<h2>relationship of learning and luxury:</h2>

<blockquote><p>What gives rise to all of these abuses, if not the fatal inequality introduced among men by the distinction of talents and the disparagement of the virtues? This is the most obvios effect of all our studies, and the most dangerous in its consequences.</p></blockquote>

<p>You get some people who seem to be really smart and other people who aren&#8217;t so smart. You begin to get <strong>some people who look up to the writer, the pholosopher, the scientist</strong> and <strong>say, oh, I wish I could be like that</strong>. <strong>At this moment you have introduced a whole form of corruption.</strong></p>

<p>That it&#8217;s going to be a slippery slope for human beings because they will try to be someone they are not and <strong>for Rousseau that is a form of dishonesty.</strong></p>

<p>Writes get into this more all the time, scientists, thinkers get into this mode, they are perfoming for someone else, they are creating luxuries, introducing inequality and <strong>under the guise</strong> (облик) of <strong>promoting knowledge</strong> they are promoting a kind of <strong>dishonesty</strong>, we might call today <strong>inauthenticity</strong> (недостоверность).</p>

<p>Slippery slope of modernity. We&#8217;re getting further and further away from who we naturally should be, who are by nature.</p>

<p>But, in the end of discorse we see a little surprise after those previous radical talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>Let learned men of the first rank find honorable asylum in their courts. Let them there receive the only reward worthy of them; by the credit they enjoy, to contribute to the happiness of the People to whom they have taught wisdom.
* he&#8217;s just told us why inequality is so bad, slippery slope of enlightment. what he says is the cure? To give th esmart people power. Why is that? Because we can&#8217;t go backward, can&#8217;t strip off our enlightenment and go backwards. This is the diasese, the cure is to use learned men, to try to institute political change.</p></blockquote>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/07/31/july-31-wednesday/">Nutrition [Week 6]</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Nutrition Digestion and Absorption</h1>

<p>Gastrointestinal tract is responsible for receiving food:</p>

<ul>
<li>receives food: takes food from mouth</li>
<li>separates nutrients from foods: releasing them in stomach</li>
<li>transports nutrients via blood: microvilli in small intestine transfer nutrients into portal blood</li>
<li>excretes indigestible waste: fecal waste</li>
</ul>


<h1>Digestive system</h1>

<ul>
<li>mouth</li>
<li>pharynx</li>
<li>salivary glands</li>
<li>esophagus</li>
<li>liver (bile is made. bile is important in helping to digest and absorb fat)</li>
<li>stomach (secrete (выделяют) acids and protein-digesting enzimes)</li>
<li>pancreas (releases a number of different hormones and bicarbonate. Bicarbonate is to help neutralize the intestinal contents, neytralizing acid content, also produces enzymes that digest carbohydrate, protein, and fat.)</li>
<li>gallbladder (stores bile, and then relases it into the small intestine when it&#8217;s needed)</li>
<li>small intestine (responsible for absorbing nutrients into the blood or the lymph. most of the nutritions absobed)</li>
<li>large intestine (water and vitamines and minerals absorbed. it&#8217;s home to bacteria that help ferment some of the fibers that you eat)</li>
<li>anus (waste)</li>
</ul>


<h1>The Stomach</h1>

<p>Esophagus -> Lower esophageal sphincter -> Fundus -> Pyloric sphincter</p>

<p>Spincter helps to keep acid inside the stomach. Primarty nutrients absorbed - water, alcohol, minerals. Highly acidic enviroment and it secretes a lot of gastric juices:</p>

<ul>
<li>hydrochloric acid (denatures protein and activate pepsin)</li>
<li>pepsin (enzume that digest protein)</li>
<li>gastric lipase (enzume that digest fat)</li>
<li>mucus ( protects stomach lining)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Small Intestine</h1>

<ul>
<li>main site for digestion and absorption</li>
<li>chyme moved by peristalsis and mixed by rhythmic constractions called segmentation</li>
<li>20 feet long</li>
<li>undigested pass from small to large intestine through a sphinchter</li>
</ul>


<h2>Parts of the small intestine:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Duodenum: minerals (calcium, phsphorus, magnesium, iron, copper) and vitamins (thamin, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, folate, A,D,E,K)</li>
<li>Jejunum: minerals (calcuymm phowphous, magnesium, iron, zinc, chromium, mangenese, molybdenum) vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenate, biotin, folate, B6, C, A,D,E,K; lipids; carbohydrates: monosaccharides; protins: amino acids and small peptides</li>
<li>Ileum: minerals (magnesium), vitamin C, B12, D, K, folate, bile salts and acids</li>
</ul>


<h1>The large intestine</h1>

<ul>
<li>made up of the colon and rectum</li>
<li>5 feet long</li>
<li>water, some vitamins and minerals are absorbed here</li>
<li>intestinal microflora break down fiber, synthesize small amount of B vitamins, K vitamin</li>
<li>from colon, contents pass to rectum where stored untill excreted via anus</li>
</ul>


<h1>FODMAPS approch</h1>

<p>FODMAPS - food-based approach to controlling some of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Compounds produce gas-producing osmotic effects;</p>

<h2>FODMAPS in foods:</h2>

<ul>
<li>food where fructose > glucose (honey, apples, pears, mango, watermelon, corn syrup)</li>
<li>frucrans (wheat, rye onion, garlic, artichokes, asparagus, beetroot, leek)</li>
<li>galactans (cabbage, legumes)</li>
<li>lactose (milk)</li>
<li>polyols (sorbitol and mannitol in stone fruits, prines, mushrooms, lychee)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Celiac Disease and the Gluten Free Diet</h1>

<p>Celiac diseas is autoimmune disease, also called gluten sensitive enteripathy or celiace sprue. Gluten which is a component of food, leads to villus atrophy, in the small intestine.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Plan:</h1>

<p>All about Justice!</p>

<hr />

<p>Objections to the idea that there are obligations of solidarity or membership.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If obligations flow from community membership and identity, we inhabit multiple communities. Doesn&#8217;t that mean that our obligations will sometimes conflict?</p></li>
<li><p>These examples meant to bring out the moral force of solidarity and membership, examples about parents and children, about the French resistance fighter asked to bomb his own village and drawing back, about the airlift Ephiopian Jews - it&#8217;s point to matters of emotions, sentiment, not true moral obligations.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Julia Rotow said that liberalism can endorse patriotism as a voluntary moral obligation. Patriotism and familial love both fall under this category, because after all, the Kantian framework allows people free reign to choose to express virtues such as these if they want to.</p>

<p>Rawls says, when he&#8217;s discussing political obligation, it&#8217;s one thing <strong>if someone runs for office or enlists in the military, they&#8217;re making a voluntary choice. But there is, I believe, no political obligation, strictly speaking, for citizens generally because it&#8217;s not clear what is the requisite bingind action and who has perfomed it.</strong> Rawls acknowledges that for ordinary citizens, there is no political obligation except insofar as some particular citizen willingly (охотно), through an act of consent undertakes or chooses such an obligation.</p>

<p>We can choose, if we want to, to express a loyalty to our country or to our people or to our family, provided we don&#8217;t do any injustice within the framework of universal duties.</p>

<p><strong>Obligations of membership really are kind of collective selfishness. Why should we honor them? Isn&#8217;t it just a kind of prejudice?</strong></p>

<p>Example of loyalty that can and should compete with universal moral claims, respect for persons?</p>

<h2>Dan&#8217;s dillema of loyalty</h2>

<p>Billy Bulger has a brother Whitey Bulger, his brother was in most wanted list, resposible for many murders and now a fugitive from justice. US Attorney called to Billy Bulger to get information about his brother and his refused to give it. You feel more loyalty to your brother than to the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts?</p>

<blockquote><p>I never thought of it that way, but I do have a loyalty to my brother. I care about him. I hipe that I&#8217;m never helpful to anyone against him. I don&#8217;t have an obligation to help anyone catch my brother&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Example with Robert E. Lee</h2>

<p>was an officer of Union Army. When war loomed, Lincoln offered Lee to be the commanding general of the Union Army and Lee refused. Why?</p>

<blockquote><p>With all my devition to the Union&#8230; I have not been able to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relatives, my children, my home. If the Union is dissolved I shall return to my native state and share miseries of my people. Save in her defense, I will draw my sword no more. Robert E. Lee</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the worries underlying these multiple objections to the idea of loyalty or membership as having independent moral weight is that it seem to argue that there is no way of finding principles of justice that are detached from conceptions of the good life as they may be lived in any particular community.</p>

<p><em>Suppose</em> the communitarian idea right over the good can&#8217;t be sustained.</p>

<p><em>Suppose</em> instead that justice and right unavoidably are bound up with conceptions of the good. Does that mean that justice is simply a creature of convention, of the values that happened to prevail in any given community at any given time?</p>

<blockquote><p>Justice is relative to social meanings. A given society is just if its substantive (основное, самостоятельный, независимый) life is lived in a certain way, <strong>in a way that is faithful (верный, верующий) to the shared understandings of the members</strong>. Michael Walzer</p></blockquote>

<p>Eyes on the Prize</p>

<hr />

<h1>Lecture 23. Same-Sex marriage</h1>

<p>I would like to defend the narrative conception of the person as against the voluntarist conception. I would like to defend the ideat that there are obligations of solidatiry or membership.</p>

<p>If our encompassing loyalty should always take precedence over more particular one, then the distinction between friends and strangers should ideally be overcome. <em>Our special concern for the welfare of friends would be a kind of prejudice, a measure of our distance from universal human concern</em>. But if you look closely at that idea, what kind of a moral universe, what kind of moral imagination would that lead you to?</p>

<blockquote><p>A tryly virtuous man would come to the aid of the most distant stranger as quickly as to his own friend. <strong>If men were perfectly virtuous, they wouldn&#8217;t have friends.</strong> Montesquieu</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the time, we live our lives by smaller solidarities. We leran to love humanity, not in general, but through its particular expressions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to distinguish <strong>two different ways in which justce can be tied to the good:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>relativist way</strong> - that&#8217;s the way that says, to think about rights, to think about justice, look to the values that happened to prevail in any given community, at any given time. Don&#8217;t judge them by some outside standart, but instead conceive justice as a matter of being faithful to the shared understandings of a particular tradition. But there&#8217;s a problem with this way of tying justice to the good. The problem is that <strong>it makes justice wholly conventional, a product of circumstance.</strong> And this <strong>deprives (лишает)</strong> justice of its critical character.</p></li>
<li><p>non-relativist way of linking justice with conceptions of the good, principles of justice depend for their justification, not on the values that happen to prevail at any given moment, in a certain place, but instead on the moral worth or the instrinsic good of the ends right serve. It&#8217;s not communitarian, ib by communitarian you mean just giving over to a particular community the definition of justice.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>first is insufficient</strong>, because the first leaves justice the creature of convention. <em>It doesn&#8217;t give us enough moral resources to respond to those Southern segregationist</em> who invoke their way of life, their traditions, their way of doing things.</p>

<p>But if justice is bound up with the good in non-relativist way, there&#8217;s a big challenge, a big question to answer. How can we reason about the good? What about the fact that people hold different conceptions of the good, different ideas about the purposes of key social institutions, different ideas about what social goods and human goods are worthy of honor and recognition? <strong>We leave in the prulorist society. People disagree about the good. That&#8217;s one of the incentives (стимулы) to try to find principles of justice and rights that don&#8217;t depend on any particular ends or purposes or goods.</strong></p>

<p>Is it necessary, is it unavoidable, when arguing about justice, to argue about the good? It&#8217;s unavoidable, it&#8217;s necessary.</p>

<h1>Same sex marriage</h1>

<p>Controversial ideas, morally and religiously. Hotly contested moral and religious questions about the moral permissibility of homosexuality, about the proper ends of marriage as a social institution.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Lecture 24: Justice and the good Life</h1>

<p>Is it necessary, is it unavoidable to take up questions of the good life in thinking about justice?</p>

<p>Is it possuble to reason about justice?</p>

<blockquote><p>Many hold equally strong religious, moral, and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled to be married, that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us. Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</p>

<p>What is at stake is respect for individual autonomy and equality under law. At stake is an individual freely choosing the person with whom to share an exclusive commitment.</p></blockquote>

<p>If government really must be neutral then the consistent position is what we have been describing as abolition (упразднение) of marriage at least as a state function. Dis-establishment of religion</p>

<p>The reason for the opposition to same sex marriage is that it would go beyond neutral toleration and give same sex marriage a government stamp of approval.</p>

<p>Same sex marriage can&#8217;t be justified on the basis of liberal neutrality or nondiscrimination or autonomy rights alone. Because the question at stake in the public debate is whether same sex unions have moral worth, whether they&#8217;re worthy of honor and recognition, and whether they fit the purpose of the social institution of marriage.</p>

<blockquote><p>Let churches and other religious institutions offer marriage ceremonies. Let depertment stores and cainos get into the act if they want to. Let couples celebrate their union in any way they choose and consider themselves married whenever they want. Michael Kinsley</p>

<p>And if three people want to get married, or if one person wants to marry himself or herself, and someone else wants to conduct a ceremony for them and declare them married, let them. If you and your government aren&#8217;t implicated (вовлечено), what do you care?</p>

<p>In a real sense there are three partners to every civil marriage: two willing spouses and an approving State. Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment, and also a highly public celebration of the ideals of mitiality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. Supreme Court</p></blockquote>

<h1>Telos of marriage</h1>

<blockquote><p>Not procreation, but the exclusive and permanent commitment of the partners to one another is the essential point and purpose of marriage. Supreme Court</p></blockquote>

<p>If reasoning about the good is unavoidable in debates about justice and rights, is it possible? If reasoning about the good means that <strong>you must have a single principle or rule, or maxim, or criterion for the good life</strong> that you <em>simply plug in every time you have a disagreement about morality</em>, then <strong>the answer is no</strong>.</p>

<p>Moving back and forth between our judgments about particular cases, events, stories, questions and more general principles that makes sense of our reasons for the positions we take on the particular cases.</p>

<blockquote><p>A conception of justice cannot be deduced from self-evident premises. Its justification is a matter of the mutual support of many considerations, of everything fitting together into one coherent view. John Rawls</p>

<p>Moral philosophy is Socratic. We may want to change our present considered judgments once their regulative principles are brought to light. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<p>Rawls thinks the method of reflective equilibrium can generate shared judgments about justice in the right, but he doesn&#8217;t think they can generate shared judgments aboit the good life, about what he call <strong>comprehensive (комплексный, всесторонний) moral and religious questions.</strong>
And the reason he thinks that, is that he says that in modern societies there is a <strong>fact of reasonable pluralism about the good.</strong> Even conscientious people who reason well, will find that they disagree about questions of the good life, about morality and religion.</p>

<p>Some people favor a libertarian theory of justice, other a more egalitarian theory of justice and they argue. And there is pluralism in our society, as between free market, laissez-faire, libertarian theories of justice, and more egalitarian ones.</p>

<p>On the liberal conception, to respect our fellow citizen&#8217;s moral and religious convictions is, so to speak, to ignore them for political purposes, to rise above, abstract from or to set aside those moral and religious convictions, to leave them undisturbed, to carry out our political debate withour reference to them.</p>

<p>Different conception of respect, according to which we respect our fellow citizen&#8217;s moral and religious convictions not by ignoring, but by engaging them, by attending to them, sometimes by challenging and contesting them, sometimes by listening and learning from them. <em>The respect of deliberation and engagement, seems to me a more adequate, more suitable ideal for a pluralist society.</em></p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/07/28/july-28-sunday/">21. Justice, Community and Membership // 12. Death Personal Identity</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Kant thinks that Aristotle made a mistake. It&#8217;s one thing, Kant says, to support a fair framework of rights within which people can pursue their own conceptions of the good life. It&#8217;s something else that runs the risk of coercion, to base law or principles of justice on any particular conception of the good life.</p>

<blockquote><p>In order to investigate the ideal constitution, we have first to figure out the best way to live. Aristotle</p></blockquote>

<p>Kant would reject that idea. He says that constitutions and laws and rights should not embody or affirm or promote any particular way of life. That&#8217;s at odds with freedom.</p>

<p>For <strong>Aristotle</strong>, the whole point of law, the purpose of the polis, is to shape character, to cultivate the virtue of citizens, <strong>to inculcate civic excellence, to make possible a good way of life</strong>.</p>

<p>For <strong>Kant</strong> on the other hand, <strong>the purpose of law, the point of a constitution, is not to inculcate or to promote virtue, it&#8217;s to set up a fair framework of rights within which citizens may be free to pursue their own conceptions of the good for themselves.</strong></p>

<h1>To be free person:</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Aristotle: we&#8217;re free insofar as we have the capacity to realize our potential. And that leads us to the question of fit, fit between persons and the roles that are appropriate to them. <strong>To live up to my potential</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Kant: notion of freedom as the capacity to act autonomously. Freedom means acting according to a law I give myself, freedom as autonomy. Consists in the conception of the person <strong>as a free and independent self, capable of choosing his or her own ends.</strong></p></li>
</ul>


<p>As free moral persons we are not bound by any ties of history, or of tradition or of inherited status, that we haven&#8217;t chosen for ourselves. And so we&#8217;re unbound by any moral ties prior to our choosing them and that means that we are free and independent sovereign selves. __We are the authors of the only obligations that constrain us.</p>

<p>Critics of Kant and Rawls - it misses something, it misses a whole dimension of moral life and even political life. <em>It can&#8217;t make sense of our moral experience because it can&#8217;t account for certain moral and political obligations that we commonoly recognize and even prize.</em></p>

<h1>Alasdair Macintyre:</h1>

<p><em>Narrative conception of the self</em> - man is &#8230; essentially a story-telling animal. That means I can only answer the question &#8220;what am I to do?&#8221; if I can answer the prior question of &#8220;what story or stories do I find myself a part?&#8221;</p>

<h1>Idea of community and belonging</h1>

<p>Once you accept this narrative aspect of moral reflection, you will notice that we can never seek for the good or exercise the virtues only as individuals&#8230; we all approach our own circumstatnces as bearers of a particular social identity. I am someone&#8217;s son or daughter, a citizen of this or that city. I belong to this clan, that tribe this nation.</p>

<p>Hence, what is good for me has to be the good for someone who inhabits these roles. I inherit from the past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation a variery of debts, inheritances, expectations and obligations.</p>

<p>These constitute the given of my life, my omral starting point. This is, in part, what gives my life its moral particularity.</p>

<p>It seems that narative conception of the self encumbered to some extent byt the history, the tradition, the communities of which it&#8217;s a part. We can&#8217;t make sense of our lives. Not only as a psychological matter, but also as a moral matter in thinking what we ought to do without attending to these features about us.</p>

<p><strong>From the standpoint of individualism, I am what I myself choose to be.</strong> I can&#8217;t be held responsible for what my father does or my country does or has done, unless I choose to assume such responsibility.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a blidness at odds with the fill measure of responsibility, which sometimes involves collective responsibility or responsibilities that may flow from historic memories. And example about Americans that dines any responsibility for the effects of slavery upon black Americans, saying, I never owned any slaves. Or the young German who believes that having been born after 1945 means that what Nazis did to Jews has no moral relevance to his relationship to Jews. <strong>Historical amnesia</strong></p>

<p>Once you see that who we are and what it mean to sort out our obligations can&#8217;t be separated, shouldn&#8217;t be separated, from the life histories that define us.</p>

<blockquote><p>The contrast with the narrative view of the self is clear. For the story of my life is always embeddes in the story of those communities from which I derive my identity.</p>

<p>I am born with a past, and to try to cut myself off from that past is to deform my present relationships.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Self can&#8217;t be detached, shouldn&#8217;t be detached from its particular ties of membership, history, story, narrative.</strong></p>

<p>On the liberal conception, moral and political obligations arise in one of two ways. There are natural duties that we owe human beings as such, duties of respect for persons qua persons. These obligations are universal. Then, as Rawls points out, there are also voluntary obligations that we owe to particular others insofar as we have agreed, whether through a promise or a deal or a contract.</p>

<p>Now the issue between the liberal and communitarian accounts of the self - is there another category of obligation or not?</p>

<p><strong>communitarian</strong> says there is, they argues that contruing all obligations as either natural duties or volantary obligations fails to capture obligations of membership or solidarity. Loyalties whose moral force consists partly in the fact that living by them is inseparable from understanding, ourselves as the particular persons we are.</p>

<p>Examples of obligations of membership that are particular, but not necessarily flow from consent, but rather from membership, narrative, community. Example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>relations between parents and children. Suppose there were two children drowning, one&#8217;s yours. Flip coin?</p></li>
<li><p>during world war II, French resistance pilots flew bombing raids over occupied France. One day, one of the pilot received his target and noticed that the village he was being asked to bomb was his home village. He refused, it would be special moral crime for him to bomb his people, even in a cause that he supported, that cause of liberating France. Do we admire that? If we do, the communitarian argues, it&#8217;s because we do recognize obligations of solidarity.</p></li>
<li><p>famine in Ethiopia. Hundres of thousands people was starving. The Israeli government organaized an airlift to rescue Ethiopian Jews, they didn&#8217;t have the capacity to rescue everyone in Ethiopea, and they rescued several hundred. Is that special obligation of solidarity that thus airlift properly responded to?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>That takes us to the broader question of patriotism. What is difference between people that lives in Franklin, Texas and Franklin, Mexico. Accroding to the communitarian account membership does matter. And the reason <strong>patriotism is at least potentially a virtue, is that it is an expression of the obligations of citizenship.</strong></p>

<h1>Death: Peronal Identity, Part III</h1>

<p>There&#8217;s the soul view, the body view, and the personality view.</p>

<p>The <strong>body view</strong> says <em>follow the body</em>.</p>

<p>The <strong>personality view</strong> says <em>follow the personality</em>, that is, the set of beliefs, desires, memories, goals, ambitions, and so forth.</p>

<h1>Science fiction experiments </h1>

<p>from Bernard Williams. Tourture me and someone else, lets say John. Swap brains between me and John, then mad scientist asks <strong>which one should I torture?</strong> My mind in John body and of course I&#8217;ll say - tourture John mind in my body, because I don&#8217;t want to feel pain even in John body. This is me. That follows then that this intuition suggests that what I find intuitively plausible is the personality theory of personal identity.</p>

<h1>II</h1>

<p>Mad scientist asks <em>&#8220;Before I torture you, what I&#8217;m going to do is give you amnesia. I&#8217;m going to completely scrub clean your brain so that you won&#8217;t remember that you&#8217;re Ruslan, from Russia, you will not have any memories of deciding to become a nobody. You will not remember getting merried, the whole thing wiped cliean, cimplete perfect amnesia before I torture you&#8221;</em>.</p>

<p>No, no, i don&#8217;t feel better, I&#8217;m still going to be tortured. If I don&#8217;t want this thing over here to be tortured, that must be because I think it&#8217;s me. But if it&#8217;s me, what&#8217;s the key to personal identity? Well, not personality, because after all, this doesn&#8217;t end up with Ruslan&#8217;s personality before the torture. This is Ruslan&#8217;s body and that suggests if I don&#8217;t want this to be tortured, it&#8217;s because I believe in the body theory of personal identity.</p>

<p><strong>Which one should we believe?</strong></p>

<p>According to the personality theory, whether somebody is me depends on whether he&#8217;s got my beliefs. Example about insane person in asylum in Michigan who believes he&#8217;s Napoleon. Yet, the personality theory, the objection says, would tell us that he is Napoleon because he&#8217;s got the beliefs of Napoleon. He&#8217;s got Napoleon&#8217;s personality.</p>

<p><em>The personality view <strong>doesn&#8217;t say anybody who has any elements at all of my personality is me</strong>. One belief in common is obviously not enough.</em></p>

<p>We were simplifying it, getting it wrong, when we said, &#8220;Follow the personality. If you&#8217;ve got Napoleon&#8217;s personality, that&#8217;s enough to make you Napoleon.&#8221; That&#8217;s not true. We need to throw in an extra clause to deal with branching, splitting cases, of the sort that I&#8217;ve just been talking about. We need to say, if there&#8217;s somebody in the future who&#8217;s got my personality, that person is me, as long as there&#8217;s only one person around in the future who&#8217;s got my personality. If you have multiple examples, duplications, splittings and branchings, nobody, none of them is me. <strong>Seems bizarre</strong></p>

		<p>Plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Justice Lecture 20: Aristotle: Freedom vs fit</li>
<li>Week 6: The cost of cybercrime</li>
<li>Death Lecture 11: Personal Identity, Part II: The Body Theory and the Personality Theory</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>Teleological - we first have figure out the purpose or the end of the social practice in question. Justice for Aristotle is a matter of fit.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement (that is what distinguishes games from productive activity). Justice Antonin Scalia</p>

<p>Many, indeed, consider walking to be the central feature of the game of golf. Hence, Mark Twain&#8217;s classic criticism of the sport - &#8216;a good walk spoiled&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>If justice is about fit, fitting persons to roles, matching virtues to the appropriate honors and recognition. Does it leave room for freedom? What room does teleology leave for freedom? <strong>Rawl rejects teleological accounts of justice</strong>, because he says that teleological theories of justice threaten the equal, basic rights of citizens.</p>

<p>Aristotle&#8217;s defense of slavery, which existed as an institution in the Athens of his day:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>slavery is necessary. why? if there are to be citizens who are freed from manual, and menial, and household chores to go to the assembly to deliberate about politics, there have to be some who look after those menial tasks. The mere necessities of life.</p></li>
<li><p>slave must be in fit, fit by nature. These are people who differ from ordinary people in the same way that the body differs from the soul. These are people who are meant to be ruled, and for them, their nature is best realized if they&#8217;re slaves.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you tie justice to a particular conception of the good, if you see justice is a matter of fit between a person and his or her roles, you don&#8217;t leave room for freedom. And <strong>to be free is to be independent of any particular roles, or traditions, or conventions that may be handed down by my parents, or my society.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Investigate whether the right is prior to the good.</li>
<li>Investigate what it means to be a free person, a free morally agent.</li>
</ol>


<hr />

<h1>QUIZ 5</h1>

<ol>
<li>According to Aristotle, the cultivation of moral virtue arises through</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>practice</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Which of the following best represents Aristotle&#8217;s view about the role of morality in politics?</li>
</ol>


<p>Encouraging and fostering a virtuous citizenry is the primary purpose of the state.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sometimes we disagree and argue about what the telos or the purpose of a social practice really consists in. According to Aristotle, when we have those disagreements what&#8217;s at stake is</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>not just who will get what but also what qualities, what excellences of persons will be honored.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>According to Aristotle</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>the polis(the political community) exists by nature and is prior to the individual</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Casey Martin was a golfer on the PGA tour who, due to an illness, needed a golf cart to move around the course. After being denied permission to use a cart, Martin sued the PGA. Many of the tour objected to the suggestion that Martin should be allowed to use a cart. Which of the following objections to Martin&#8217;s being allowed to use the cart is an expression of teleological reasoning?</li>
</ol>


<p>Walking the course is part of the game. If you allow Martin to ride a cart, he really isn&#8217;t playing the game anymore.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Death and Personal Identity</h1>

<p>Two more views regarding the metaphysical key to personal identity are discussed: the body view and the personality view. According to the <strong>body view</strong>, an individual is <em>identified in terms of his or her physical body</em>. According to the <strong>personality view</strong>, an <em>individual is identified by his or her unique set of beliefs, desires, memories, goals, and so on.</em></p>

<p>The key to being the same person is not the sameness of the soul, whether or not it exists, but rather having the very same body. Could I survive my death? If my body dies, it&#8217;s obviously answer is no. It&#8217;s at the first glance, but it could be a logical possibility of surviving the death of my body - <strong>all it takes is for my body to be put back together</strong>. God could put back moleculs back and re-create same body, <strong>bodily resurrection</strong>.</p>

<p>Example with watch. He take them apart, cleans and fix, and then reassemble them toghether. Then a week later, I come back and ask &#8220;Where&#8217;s my watch?&#8221; - Admittedly, it&#8217;s composed of all the very same pieces that made up my watch, admittedly, all these pieces are in the very same order as my watch, but still that&#8217;s not my watch. No, it&#8217;s is my watch, it was disassembled for a period of time, perhaps we should say my watch didn&#8217;t exist during that period.</p>

<p>Example <strong>tower our of wooden blocks</strong></p>

<p>Suppose that my son builds a tower our of wooden blocks. Break it, then rebuild it, every block exact at the same position as my son builds it. And then when my wife came i said &#8220;Look, this is tower that our son built.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t sound right, it&#8217;s duplicate tower.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you have an object and you take it apart and then put it all back together again, you don&#8217;t have the very same object that you started out. Van Inwagen</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The brain</strong> is the part, we now know, the brain is the part of the body that is the house of your personality, your beliefs, your desires, your fears, your ambitions, your goals, your memories</p>

<p>The crucial part of the body is sameness of brain.</p>

<p>objections - возвражения, протест</p>

<p><strong>THE POLITICS</strong></p>

<p>Part I and Part II about early forms of society. Man -> wife -> children, xo for the plough. Man is by nature a political animal</p>

<blockquote><p>But he who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god: he is no part of a state.</p>

<p>Justice is the bond of men in states, for the administration of justice, which is the determination of what is just, is the principle of order in political society.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Part III</h1>

<p>Managments of the houshold:</p>

<ul>
<li>master and servant, husband and wife, father and children;</li>
<li>art of getting wealth;</li>
</ul>


<p>Others affirm that the rule of a master over slaves is contrary to nature, and that the distinction between slave and freeman exists by law only, and not by nature; and being an interference with nature is therefore unjust.</p>

<h1>Part IV</h1>

<p><strong>Property</strong> is a part of the household, and the art of acquiring property is a part of the art of managing the household. The master is only the master of the slave; he does not belong to him, whereas the slave is not only the slave of his master, but wholly belongs to him. Possession may be defined as an instrument of action, separable from the possessor.</p>

<h1>Part V</h1>

<p>(about <strong>slave and master</strong>)From the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.</p>

<p>In the first place, consists of soul and body: and of these two, the one is by nature the ruler, and the other the subject.</p>

<p>The male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules, and the other is ruled; this principle, of necessity, extends to all mankind.</p>

<h1>Part VI</h1>

<p>distinction between the two classes</p>

<h1>Part VII</h1>

<p>The rule of a household is a monarchy, for every house is under one head: whereas constitutional rule is a government of freemen and equals.</p>

<p>&#8216;slave before slave, master before master&#8217;. For the master need only know how to order that which the slave must know how to execute.</p>

<h1>Part VIII</h1>

<p>Art of getting wealth. Men must all have food, and the differences in their food have made differences in their ways of life.</p>

<p>the art of acquisition - element of true riches.</p>

<h1>Part IX</h1>

<p>art of wealth-getting, and has in fact suggested the notion that riches and property have no limit.</p>

<p>a shoe is used for wear, and is used for exchange; both are uses of the shoe.</p>

<p>When the use of coin had once been discovered, out of the barter of necessary articles arose the other art of wealth getting, namely, retail trade;</p>

<p>the whole idea of their lives is that they ought either to increase their money without limit, or at any rate not to lose it.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Lecture 19: The good citizen</h1>

<p>And the central idea of Aristotle&#8217;s theory of justice is that in reasoning about justice and right we have, unavoidably, to reason about the purpose, or the end, or the telos of social practice and institutions.</p>

<p>In general, it&#8217;s hard to do without <strong>teleology</strong> when we&#8217;re thinking about ethics, justice and moral argument.</p>

<p><strong>The case of politics</strong></p>

<p>how should political offices and honors, how should political rule be distributed?</p>

<p>When we discuss about politics and justice of this days, we mainly concern about the distribution of income, wealth and oportunity.</p>

<p>Artistotle took distributive justice to be mainly not about income and wealth, but about offices and honors. <strong>Who should have right to rule? Who should be a citizen? How should political authority be distributed?</strong></p>

<p>Aristotle argues that to know how political authority should be distributed we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>to inquire into the purpose, the point, the telos of politics. (Aristotle version about politics) Politics is about forming character, forming good character, it&#8217;s about cultivating the virtue of citizens. It&#8217;s about a good life.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not mere life, it&#8217;s not economic exchange only, it&#8217;s not security only, it&#8217;s realizing the good life. That&#8217;s what politics is for, according to Aristotle. Instead, for Kant and Rawls politics isn&#8217;t about making us good, it&#8217;s to respect our <strong>freedom to choose, our goods, our values, our ends, consistent with a simular liberty for others.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Aristotle disagrees with them:</p>

<blockquote><p>Any polis which is truly so called, and is not merely one in name, must devote itself to the end of encouraging <em>goodness</em>. Otherwise, political association sinks into a mere alliance.</p>

<p>Law becomes a mere covenant, a guarantor of man&#8217;s rights against one another, instead of being - as it should be - a way of life such as will make the members of a polis good and just.</p>

<p>A polis is not an association for residents on a common site, or for the sake of preventing mutual injustice and easing exchange. The end and purpose of a polis is the <strong>good life</strong>, and the institutions of social life are means to that end.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who contribute the most to an association of this character, should have a greater share in political rule and in the honors of the polis. The reason is, they are in a position to contribute most to what political community is essentially about.</p>

<p>That only by living in a polis and participating in politics do we fully realize our nature as human beings. Human beings are, by nature, meant to live in a polis. Why? It&#8217;s only in political life that we can actually exercise our distinctly human capacity for language to deliberate about right and wrong, the just and the unjust.</p>

<p>Political community is prior to the individual.</p>

<blockquote><p>A man who is isolated, who is unable to share in the benefits of political association, or who has no need to share, because he&#8217;s already self-sufficient, such a person must be either a beast or a good. Aristotle</p></blockquote>

<p>Living the life of citizen, ruling and being ruled in turn, sharing in rule, all of this is necessary to virtue. Aristotle degines happiness not as maximizing the balance of pleasure over pain, but as <strong>an acitivity</strong>, an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue.</p>

<p><strong>Virtue</strong> is only something we can acquire by practicing, by exercising the virtues. It&#8217;s the kind of thing we can learn by doing, it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t come from book learning.</p>

<p><strong>About professional golfers association should be requres to allow Casey Martin (a golfer with a disability) to ride in a golf cart</strong></p>

<p>Casey Martin ask PGA to be able to use a golf cart. PGA said no and he sued under the American for Disabilities Act, went to Supreme Court. Does Casey Martin have a right that the PGA allow him to use a golf cart on the tour?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Walking isn&#8217;t really an essential part of the game. They cited testimony saying that walking the cours consumes no more calories than you get eating a Big Mac.</p></li>
<li><p>there is no purpose, and it&#8217;s certainly not for courts to try to figure our the essential purpose of golf. Golf, like any game, is strictly for amusement and if there&#8217;s a group that want to have one version of the game - they can have that version of the game and the market can decide.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>What qualities, what excellences of persons will be honored?</p>

<h1>Death: Personal Identity</h1>

<p>What is it for me to survive my death of the body? What is it for me to survive?</p>

<p>Example about Thursday lecture and next week, what is to be the same person talking to you on Thursday. Or example about 2053 (40 years later) - is that person who&#8217;s alive in 2053 the very same person as the person who&#8217;s standing here now lecturing to you. What is it for somebody in the future to be the very same person as this person who&#8217;s here.</p>

<p><strong>Identity across space</strong></p>

<p>Car 1990 (new) &#8212;&#8212;-> Car 2000 &#8212;&#8212;> 2006 (a lot dents)</p>

<p>Think of the object extended throught time picking our by pointing to the current slice.</p>

<p>The key to personal identity</p>

<p>It&#8217;s me as long as it&#8217;s the same soul. It&#8217;s not me if it&#8217;s a different soul. If God were to replace my soul Saturday night, I die. And the thing that wakes up Sunday isn&#8217;t me.</p>

<li><s>Justice 17: Arguing Affirmative Action (позитивные действия)</s></li>
<li><s>Mobile malware</s></li>
<li>Death and continue watchin lecture about Plato and Immortality of soul</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>Suppose there are two candidates who did equally well on the tests and grades, both of whom went to first-rate schools. Among those candidates, would it be unfair for the college or univesity to say we still want diversity along racial and ethnic dimensions, even where we are not correcting for the effects on test scores of educational disadvantage.</p>

<p><em>Legacy admissions</em> is giving an advantage to someone who has an arbitraty privilege of their parent having attended the univesrity to which they&#8217;re applying.</p>

<h1>Arguments for Affirmative Action:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>One argument has to do with correcting for the effects of educational disadvantage. <strong>Corrective</strong> - <em>correcting for differences in educational backgrounds.</em> That argument is consistent in principle with the idea that only academic promise and scholarly potential should count in admissions. We just need to go beyond test scores and grades alone to get a true estimate of academic promise and scholarly ability.</p></li>
<li><p>Affirmative action is justified even where there may not be the need to correct for educational disadvantage in a particular applicant&#8217;s case. <strong>Compensatory</strong> - <em>compensating for past wrongs.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversity</strong> - (different from compensatory, because it makes a certain appeal to the social purpose or the social mission of the college or univesity) Two arguments:</p></li>
<li><p><em>for educational experience for everyone</em></p></li>
<li><em>for society as whole</em> (we need to train lawyers, and judges, and leaders, public officials who will contribute to the strength, the civic strength of the state of Texas and the country as whole)</li>
</ol>


<p>When reviewing the large number of candidates able to do well in our classes race may count as a plus, just as coming from Iowa may count or being a good middle linebacker or pianist.</p>

<p>A farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something a white student cannot offer. The quality of the educational experience of all students depends in part on these differences in the background and outlook that students bring with them.</p>

<h1>Mobile Malware</h1>

<h2>Two layers:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dalvic VM (sms send/recv)</li>
<li>OS interaction (read/write files)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Static:</h1>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>many info in the Manifest</li>
<li>java is relatively easy to decompile</li>
<li>potentially sees the whole behavior</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>obfuscation and optimizations</li>
<li>reflection</li>
<li>dynamic code, native code</li>
</ul>


<h1>Dynamic:</h1>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>resilient to obfuscation</li>
<li>potentially transparent (VMM)</li>
<li>less comples than static</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>code coverage</li>
<li>VMI can be cumbersome (громоздкий) (VMM)</li>
<li>instrumental can be detected</li>
</ul>


<h1>CopperDroid</h1>

<p>Unified dynamic analysis technique to characterize the behavior of android malware.</p>

<ol>
<li>automatically reconstruct the behaviors</li>
<li>system call centric analysis</li>
<li>android version independent</li>
<li>dynamically stimulates apps to disclose additional behaviors</li>
</ol>


<h1>System calls on Linux ARM</h1>

<p>Like on Intel, on ARM architecture invoking a system call induces a user-to-kernel transiction.</p>

<ul>
<li>On ARM invoked through the <em>swi</em> instruction</li>
<li><em>r7</em> contains the number of the invoked syscall</li>
<li><em>r0-r5</em> contain parameters</li>
<li><em>lr</em> contains the return address</li>
</ul>


<p>System call analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>intercept when a syscall is invoked</li>
<li>we need to intercept return to user-space too!</li>
<li>there is no SYSEXIT/SYSRET to intercept</li>
<li>not every syscall actually returns to <em>lr</em> (exit, execve)</li>
</ul>


<p>CopperDriod&#8217;s Approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>instruments QEMU&#8217;s emulation of the swi instruction</li>
<li>instruments QEMU to intercept every cpsr_write (Kernel -> User)</li>
</ul>


<p>CopperDroid VMI:</p>

<ul>
<li>process name</li>
<li>pid and tid</li>
<li>process resources</li>
</ul>


<p>when executing kernel code, the <em>base</em> of the stack points to the current executing thread.</p>

<p>Binder protocol is the core of Android IPC/RPC</p>

<ul>
<li>intents are carried through binder</li>
<li>interactions with the system go through binder</li>
<li>binder driver enforces (some) permission policies</li>
</ul>


<p>Application cannot send SMSs on their own, but must invoke (RPC) the proper system service to do that.</p>

<p>Android malware needs to be properly stimulated to trigger more malicious behaviors and increase coverage of dynamic analysis.</p>

<p>CopperDroid Ad-Hoc Stimuli</p>

<ol>
<li>Identifies events the target reacts to (mostly contained in the Manifest file)</li>
<li>During the analysis, injects customs evenets (of those identified as useful)</li>
</ol>


<p>MonkeyRunner to inject events.</p>

<p>CopperDroid - automatically reconstruct the behaviors of android malware.</p>

<h1>Plato with arguments for the immortality of the Soul</h1>

<p>Suppose I pluck a string on my harp, producing a certain note. As we know, the vibrations of one string can set into play the other strings vibrating as well. That would be analogous to what goes on when my mind affects my body.</p>

<p><strong>An essential property</strong> is a property that a given object must have; it always has as long as it exists at all.</p>

<p><strong>A contingent property</strong> is a property that an object may have, may happen to have its entire existence, but could&#8217;ve existed without.</p>

<p>My car is blue (contingent property), it could be red, but the car will still exist. It could exist as a red car and even if I don&#8217;t change the color, still it could be red.</p>

<p>Pencil is whole, but I could break it (contingent property).</p>

<p><strong>Fire</strong> and being hot, fire is hot, that&#8217;s property, it isn&#8217;t contingent property, it IS <em>essential property</em>!</p>

<p>Plato says &#8221;<strong>Here is an essential property for the soul. Wherever there&#8217;s a soul it&#8217;s alive (it&#8217;s thinking, something capable of thought).</strong>&#8221;</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Life is an essential property of the soul.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soul is deathless.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>_Anything that&#8217;s deathless - cannot die, indestructible.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Soul cannot be destroyed.</strong></p></li>
</ol>


<p>What does it mean to say that something is <strong>deathless</strong>?</p>

<ul>
<li>it can&#8217;t be that <strong>soul exists AND dead</strong></li>
<li>it can&#8217;t be that <strong>soul was destroyed</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>If life is an essential property of the soul, then that means we will never have soul in our hand and is dead.</p>

<p>How do you go about proving what something doesn&#8217;t exist? When do you need to prove that something doesn&#8217;t exist?
Example with dragons, how do I prove that there aren&#8217;t any dragons? Debunk about dragons and unicorns, you don&#8217;t need to check all caves around the world to say &#8220;no dragons here, no dragons in there&#8221;, <em>you are pretty much justified in being skeptical about the existence of dragons once you&#8217;ve undermined the arguments for dragons.</em></p>

<h1>Justice, Lecture 18. Aristotle: Justice and virtue</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>race and ethnice should count as a way of correcting for the true meaning of test scores and grades.</p></li>
<li><p>compensatory arguments, the idea of righting past wrongs, past injustice.</p></li>
<li><p>diversity argument. social mission, the common good (texas law school example).</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Can the university define its social purpose any way it wants to and then define admissions criteria accordingly?</strong></p>

<p>Justice is not a matter of rewarding or honoring virtue or honoring moral desert. Somehow they think tying justice to moral merit or virtue is going to lead away from freedom, from respect for persons as free beings.</p>

<p><strong>Aristotle</strong> explicitly ties justice to honor, honoring virtue and merit and moral desert.</p>

<p>For <strong>Aristotle, justice is</strong> a matter of giving people what they deserve, giving people their due. It&#8217;s a matter of figuring our the proper fir between persons with their virtues and their appropriate social roles.</p>

<p>Justice means giving each person his or her due, giving people what they deserve. <strong>But what is a person&#8217;s due?</strong>
Aristotle says that depends on the sort of things being distributed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Justice involves two factors: <strong>things</strong> and the <strong>persons</strong> to whom the things are assigned. In general we say that persons who are equal should have equal things assigned to them. Aristotle</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Equals in what respect?</strong> That depends on the sort of thing we are distributing. Example with <strong>flutes</strong> and it&#8217;s distributing. What is the relevant merit or basis of desert for flutes? Who should get the best ones? Artistotle answers was - the best flute players. All justice involves districimination, he says, what matters is that the distrimination be according to the relevant excellence, according to the virtue appropriate to having flutes. He says, it would be unjust to discriminte on some other basis in giving our the flutes.</p>

<p><strong>Why should best fluet goes to the best fluet player?</strong> Because that&#8217;s fluets are for, to be played well.</p>

<p><strong>TELOS - the point, the end, the goal</strong></p>

<p><strong>TELEOLOGICAL REASONING - Reasoning from the &#8220;telos&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><em>Reasoning from the purpose or from the telos or from the end.</em> Aristotle says that&#8217;s indispensable to thinking about justice.</p>

<hr />

<p>sovereign - суверенный, независимый
essential - существенный, основной, неотъемлемость
contingent - контингент, случай, условный, случайны
burden - бремя, нагрузка, груз
virtue - добродетель, сила, достоинство
indispensable - незаменимый, необходимый</p>

<li>Justice 16 about Distributive Justice: Who deserves what?</li>
<li>Mobile malware</li>
<li>Death Lecture 9 about Immortality of Soul</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<h1>Justice</h1>

<p>Tree differenet theory of distributed justice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Libertarian system of distribution is a system of free exchange, a free market economy</strong> against a background of formal equality, which simply means that jobs and careers are open to anyone. Carees open for talents. But still resulsts is not going to be fait, it will be biased in favor of those who happened to be born to affluent families, who happen to have the benegit of good educational opportunities. <em>And that accident of birth is not a just basis for distributing life chances.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meritocractic - fair equality of opportunity</strong>. The fastest runner will win.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Egalitarian (Democratic conception) - Rawls difference principle.</strong> People may gain, may benefit from their good fortune but only on terms that work to the advantage of the least well-off.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Objections to difference principle:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What about incentives (стимул)? Isn&#8217;t there the risk if taxes reach 70%, 80%, 90% marginal rate that Michael Jordan won&#8217;t play basketball, or CEO.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>The natural advantaged are not to gain merely because they are more gifted, but only to cover the costs of training and education and for using their endowments (пожертвования) in ways that help the less fortunate as well. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>What about effort? What about people working hard, having a right to what they earn because they deserved it? They&#8217;ve worked hard for it.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Life is not fair. It is tempting to believe that government can rectify (исправлять) what nature has spawned. Milton Friedman (book Free to Choose)</p>

<p>The natural distribution is neither just nor unjust; nor is it unjust that persons are born into society at some particular position. These are simply natural facts. What is just and unjust is the way that institutions deal with these facts. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>What about self-ownership?</li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe we don&#8217;t own ourselves in that thoroughgoing (радикальный) sense after all. This doesn&#8217;t mean that the state is an owner in me in the sence that it can simply commandeer my life, because remember the first principle we would agree to behind the veil of ignorance is <em>the principle of equal basic liberties (freedom of speech, religious liberty, freedom of conscience and the like)</em>. I own myself in the sense that I have a privileged claim on the benefits that come from the exercise of my talents in a market economy, and Rawls says on reflection, we don&#8217;t! We can defend right, we can respect the individual without embracing the idea of self-possession.</p>

<p>Example about constructors Big vs Small. Big can build wall in couple hours when Small could do same thing in couple days. Meritocracy says Big deserves to make more. It isn&#8217;t really effort, contributions matters.</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between moral deserts and entitlement?</strong></p>

<p>Consider two different games, a game of chance and a game of skill. Take a <em>game of pure chance</em> - just a game of luck, no sense in which I morally deserve to win in the first place. Ok, then let&#8217;s see <em>game of skill</em>, 49 vs raiders - it can be always asked of a game of skill, did the deserve to win?</p>

<p>Rawls says distributive justice is not a matter of moral desert, though, it is a matter of entitlements to legitimate expectations:</p>

<blockquote><p>A just scheme answers to what men are entitled to; it satisfies their legitimate expectations as founded upon social institutions. But what they are entitled to is not proportional to or dependent upon their intrinsic worth. John Rawls</p>

<p>The principles of justice that regulate the basic structure&#8230; do not mention moral desert, and there is no tendency for distributive shares to correspond to it.</p></blockquote>

<p>My talants reap in a market economy, what does it depend on? What other people happen to want or like in this society, it depends on the law of supply and demand. That&#8217;s not my doing, what counts as contributing depends on the qualities that this or that society happens to prize. <em>In a capitalist society it helps to have entepreneurial drive.</em></p>

<p>We are antitled to the benefits that the rules of the game promise for the exercises of our talents.But it&#8217;s a mistake and conceit (тщаславие, самомнение) to suppose that we deserve in the first place a society that values the qualities we happen to have in abundance (изобилии)</p>

<hr />

<h1>Quiz 4</h1>

<h2>1. What is the original position?</h2>

<p>A hypothetical scenario in which people who are temporarily placed behind a veil of ignorance that covers up their knowledge about who in particular they are ( e.g. their social status and natural talents) choose the principles of justice for their society.</p>

<h2>2. What is the main function of the veil of ignorance?</h2>

<p>To ensure that people are not biased by knowledge about particular facts about themselves (e.g. how strong or intelligent they are) when thinking about matters of justice.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why, according to Rawls, is a hypothetical contract between people of equal standing who are placed behind a veil of ignorance morally more significant than an actual contract?</li>
</ol>


<p>Because it is not tainted by assymetries in bargaining power (e.g. differences in people&#8217;s wealth or intelligence or strength)</p>

<ol>
<li>Individuals who use their talents to earn an income on the free market sometimes claim that they ought to be allowed to keep all of that income because they morally deserve it. How would Rawls respond to this?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>The fact that you were born with the talents you have is a morally arbitrary fact. You do not morally deserve your talents, and so the claim that you deserve the wealth that your talents attract is dubious.</p>

<p>The fact that you were born in a society in which your particular talents are in high demand or in low supply is a morally arbitrary fact. The fact that your particular talents are in high demand or in low supply is what allows you to use those talents to become wealthy. So the claim that you deserve the wealth that your talents attract is dubious.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Rawls think that people are justified in owning the objects and wealth that they do when:</li>
</ol>


<p>The objects and wealth were acquired withint a market regulated by principles of justice that protect individual liberties and fair equality of opportunity for all and then work to the benefit of the least well-off members of society.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture 9 - Plato, Part IV: Arguments for the Immortality of the Soul</strong></p>

<p>Idestructible mean immortal. What is to be for some things being indestructible?</p>

<p>Changing is a matter of the rearrangment of the parts. If something can change it is not simple.</p>

<p><strong>Sould does indeed change</strong>. One day you believe, for example, that it&#8217;s hot, next day it&#8217;s cold. Desire to learn piano and then give up about it.</p>

<p>Soul is simple? In Republic Plato argues that <strong>soul not simple at all</strong> (three parts, rational, spirited, appetite).</p>

<p>Simple can&#8217;t destroy, because they don&#8217;t have parts and you can&#8217;t take them apart. But what about if just <em>goes our of existence</em></p>

<p>Haromny of the harp, like mind to the body. Harmony is something that gets produced by a well-tuned instrument, the soul or the mind is something that gets produced by well-tunned body.</p>

<h1>Plato says:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Harmony crearly cannot exist before the existence of the harp itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Harmony can vary (melodiosly of harp). The mental aspect can come in degree, intelligence, creativity, reasonbless and like.</p></li>
<li><p>Soul can be good or it can be evil. Harmonious soul? Looks strange, but we say mind/soul is like the harmony.</p></li>
<li><p>Soul is capable to directing your body. Your soul can opposed your body. Function of the body can wiggle my finger, my mind give instruction my body (my brain give instruction to other part of my body - fingers). As melody can affect the harp.</p></li>

<h1>Defining Obesity</h1>

<ul>
<li>82% increase in global obesity X 20 years</li>
<li>middle east 100% increase since 1990</li>
<li>2008: > 1.4 billion adults, age 20+ overweight</li>
<li>200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese</li>
<li>65% global population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweigth</li>
<li>more than 40 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2010</li>
</ul>


<p>Louis Dublin:</p>

<ul>
<li>small, medium, large</li>
<li>20-25% > desirable wt for frame</li>
<li>70-100% > desirable wt for frame</li>
</ul>


<p>Adolphe Quetelet create quetelet index (1832), weight increases as the square of the height</p>

<p>Dr. Ancel Keys confirmed validity of Quetelet index and coined the term &#8220;BMI&#8221; in 1972.</p>

<p>BMI - kg/m2 or (lb/in2) * 703:</p>

<ul>
<li>underweight &lt; 18.5</li>
<li>normal weight 18.5 - 24.9</li>
<li>overweight 25.0 - 29.9</li>
<li>obese > 30</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additional Measurements:</h2>

<ul>
<li>waist circumference</li>
<li>waist-to-hip ratio</li>
<li>skinfold thickness</li>
<li>percent body fat (bioelectrical impedance, underwater weighung, DEXA)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Causes of Obesity</h2>

<ul>
<li>increased intake of energy-dense food that are high in fat, salt and sugar but low in vitamins and minerals</li>
<li>decrease in physical activity</li>
</ul>


<h1>2. Energy Balance</h1>

<p><em>Intake</em> (calories from food) and <em>Output</em> (calories used to maintain body function and physical activity)</p>

<p>Intake:</p>

<ul>
<li>protein</li>
<li>fat</li>
<li>carbohydrates</li>
<li>alcohol</li>
</ul>


<p>Output:</p>

<ul>
<li>basal metabolism (burning just sitting)</li>
<li>thermic effect of food (burning to process)</li>
<li>physical activity (15-30% of total energy expenditure, walking, yard work)</li>
<li>thermogenesis (sleeping, eating, sports-like exercise)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Storage of Excess Calories:</h2>

<ul>
<li>excess carbohydrate stores as fat</li>
<li>excess protein stores as fat</li>
<li>excess fat stores as fat (converted and stores as fat)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Metabolic fitness</h2>

<ul>
<li>central obesity</li>
<li>triglyceride levels</li>
<li>HDL</li>
<li>blood pressure</li>
<li>fasting blood glucose</li>
</ul>


<h1>3. Metabolic syndrome</h1>

<p>Claster of risk factors. Heart deasis, stroke, diabet.</p>

<p>Criteria for Metabolic Syndrome(at least 3 of those 5):</p>

<ul>
<li>waist circumference (males > 40 inches, females 35 inches)</li>
<li>high blood pressure > 130/85 mm Hg</li>
<li>fasting blood sugar > 110 mm Hg</li>
<li>triglycerides > 150 mm Hg</li>
<li>HDL males &lt; 40 mg/dL, females &lt; 50 mg/dL</li>
</ul>


<p>Apple-shaped fat patterning (more dangerious) and Pear-shaped fat patterning.</p>

<p>Metabolic syndrome doubled the risk of heart attack in both men and women.</p>

<h1>4. Pediatric Obesity</h1>

<p>1:6 US children obese; 1:3 are overweigh or obese</p>

<p>6-11 year old:</p>

<ul>
<li>1980 7%</li>
<li>2008 20% (tripled)</li>
</ul>


<p>12-19 year old:</p>

<ul>
<li>1980 5%</li>
<li>2008 18%</li>
</ul>


<p>43 millions preschool in 2010 (35 million of these are in development country). As countries wealth increases traditional diet towards a more westernized diet.</p>

<p>Kant says that laws arise from a vertain kind of social contract. But this contract is of an exceptional nature. He points out that <em>the contract that generates justice</em> is what he calls an <em>idea of reason</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A contract that generates principles of right is merely an idea of reason, but it has undoubted practical reality, because it can oblige (обязывать) every legislator to frame his laws in such a way that they could have been produced by the united will of the whole nation. Immanuel Kant</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>What is the moral force of a hypthetical contract, a contract that never happened?</strong></p>

<p>John Rawls who worked out in his book a detail an acouunt of a hypothetical agreement as the basis for justice. Like Kant, Rawls was a critic of utilitarianism:</p>

<ol>
<li><blockquote><p>Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override&#8230; The rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining (переговоры) or to the calculus of social interests. John Rawls</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>Principles of justice, properly undersood, can be derived from hypothetical social contract, not an actual one. (Veil (вуаль) of ignorance).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The way to arrive at the basic right that we must respect, the basic framework of rights and duties is to imagine that we were gathered together trying to choose the principles to govern our collective lives without knowing cerain important particular facts about ourselves. - <strong>That&#8217;s the idea of veil of ignorance</strong></p>

<p>Veil of ignorance abstracts us from or brackets, hides from us, who in particular we are, our race, class, place in society, we&#8217;re healthy or unhealthy. Then we would agree to we come up to principles of justice. <strong>That&#8217;s how the hypothetical contract works</strong></p>

<p>What is the moral force of this kind of hypothetical agreement? Is it stronger or weaker than actual social contract?</p>

<h1>Moral force of actual contracts:</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>how do they bind or obligate me?</p></li>
<li><p>consent-based as a voluntary act and it points to the ideal of <strong>autonomy</strong>. <em>When I make a contract, the obligation is one that is self-imposed and that carries a certain moral weight independent of other considerations</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>benefit-based and this points toward the ideal of <strong>reciprocity</strong> (взаимность). <em>I can have an obligation to you insofar as you do something for me</em></p></li>
<li><p>how do actual real life contracts justife the terms they produce? they dont! at least not on their own. the fact of the agreement never garuantees the fairness of the agreement. (Constitution about persisting slaver - it was an actual contract, but that doesn&#8217;t establish that the laws agreed to, all of them, were just)</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Example</h1>

<p>We made an agreement, a commercial agreement. I promise to pay you 100$ if you will go harvest and bring to me 100 lobsters. You go our and bring them to me, I eat the lobsters, serve them to my friends and then I don&#8217;t pay. And you say, but you&#8217;re obligated! I say - why? Well, we had a deal and you benefited, you ate all those lobsters. I benefited from your labor - very strong argument.</p>

<p>Second case, then we made the agreement and in two minutes I called and say I&#8217;ve changed my mind. No benifits, no lobsters, no work you part, there is no element of reciprocal exchange. Do I still owe you?</p>

<p>paternalism (отеческое попечение)</p>

<p>A contract or an act of consent is not only not sufficient, but it&#8217;s not even a necessary condition of there being an obligation.</p>

<p><strong>David Hume</strong></p>

<p>When he was young, Hume wrote a book arguing against Locke&#8217;s idea of an original social contract. He said, &#8220;It was a philosophical fiction, one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible (непонятный) operations that can possibly be imagined&#8221;. And then when he was 62 he got an example of it:</p>

<p>house -> his friend rented it -> sub-lent it to third person and this person signed a contract with painter to paint the house and send the bill to Hume (he refused to pay). In court he said he didn&#8217;t sign any contract, that was true. Defance failed and he had to pay.</p>

<p><strong>The main idea - actual contracts have their moral force in virtue of two distinguishable ideals, autonomy and reciprocity</strong> <em>But in real life, every actual contract may fall short, may fail to realize the ideal that give contracts their moral force in the first place.</em></p>

<p>Justice Lecture 15</p>

<p>How should income and wealth and power and opportunities be distributed?</p>

<p>Why Rawls think that principles of justice are best derived from a hyphotetical contract? <em>Hyphotetical contract be carried out in an original position of equality (the veil of ignorance)</em></p>

<p>Principles choosen behind the veil of ignorance.
Fundamental right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly (свобода собраний), religious:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Utilitarism makes a mistake because forgetting it&#8217;s not taking seriosly the distinction between persons. We wouldn&#8217;t trade off our fundamental right and liberties for any economic advantages.</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#8217;s require an equal deistribution income and wealth, but we could do better if we agree to qualified principle of equality (Rawls calls it the difference principle). A principle that says only those social and economic inequalities will be permited that work to the benefit of the least well off (в интересах наименее обеспеченных). Test would be <strong>do they work to the benefit of everyone, including those, especially those at the bottom.</strong></p></li>
</ol>


<p>The distribution of income and wealth and opportunities should not be based on factors for which people can clainm no credit, it shouldn&#8217;t be based on factors that are arbitrary from a moral point of view.</p>

<p><strong>Feudal aristocracy</strong>. What&#8217;s wrong? Rawls says, the thing that&#8217;s obviosly wrong about it is that people&#8217;s life prospects are determined by the accident of birth, you can&#8217;t rise, it&#8217;s not your doing where you wind up or what opportunities you have.</p>

<p><strong>Libertarian system</strong>. What&#8217;s wrong? Rawls says, it&#8217;s an improment because it doesn&#8217;t take as fixed the accident of birth. And even so, if you let everybody run the race, everybody can enter the race, but some people start at different starting points, that race isn&#8217;t going to be fair.</p>

<p>Merit based system, a <strong>meritrocratic system</strong>. Everyone regardless of their family background, has a genuinely fair opportunity. Everyone starts from the same starting line. Rawls thinks even that, doesn&#8217;t go far enough in remedying (устранение) or addressing the moral arbitrariness of the natural lottery. Because if your bring everyone at the same starting point and begin the race, who&#8217;s going to win the race? The fastest runner would win, but is it their doing that they happen to be blessed with the athletic prowess to run fast? So, even the principle of <strong>meritocracy</strong>, where you bring everyone to the same starting point, may eliminate the influence of social contingencies and upbringing, <em>but it still permits the distribution of wealth and icome to be determined by the natural distribution of abilities and talents</em>.</p>

<p>People may benefit from their good fortune, from their luck in the genetic lottery, but only on terms that work to the advantage of the least well off.</p>

<p>Example: Michael Jordan can make $31 million, but only under a system that taxes away a chunk of that to help those who lack the basketball skills that he&#8217;s blessed with.</p>

<p>Bill Gates, but he can&#8217;t think he somehow morally deserves those billions.</p>

<blockquote><p>Those who have been favored by nature, whoever they are, may gain from their good fortune only on terms that improve the situation of those who have lost our. John Rawls</p></blockquote>

<h1>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy</h1>

<ul>
<li>Friends (wedding toast example, somehow the money, buying diminished it&#8217;s meaning and value).</li>
<li>Example with parents and childrengarden. (cash and gilty for late arriving)</li>
<li>toaster (difference - then it&#8217;s as a gift or just buy new one).</li>

<h1>Justice: Immanuel Kant: A lesson in lying</h1>

<p>Kant believes that if we choose freely, out of our own consciences (совесть), the moral law, we&#8217;re guaranteed to come up with one and <em>same moral law</em>.</p>

<p>How is a categorical imperative possible? How is morality possible?</p>

<p>two distinctives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>as an object of experience, I belong to the sensible world there my actions are determined by the laws of nature and by the regularities of causes and effect.</p></li>
<li><p>When we think of ourselves as free we transfer ourselves into the intelligible world as members and recognize the autonomy of the will.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Only because <em>the idea of freedom</em> makes me a member of an intelligible world.</p>

<p>Because of realm of freedom and realm of necessity - there is always potentially a gap between <em>what we do and what we ought to do</em>.</p>

<p>No science could deliver moral truth.</p>

<p>Case about murderer at the door, looking for your friend who was hiding in your house and the mureder ask you &#8220;is your friend in your house?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Kant says it&#8217;s wrong to lie even to the murderer at your door. But misleading truth pays a certain homage (дань) to duty.</p>

<ul>
<li>plausible (правдоподобный)</li>
</ul>


<h1>QUIZ 3</h1>

<ol>
<li>Which of the following best captures Kant&#8217;s Formula of Humanity as End?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in any other person, always at the same time as an end, never merely as means.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>I am to make a deceitful (лживый) promise in circumstances in which my situation is such that I am in real need of money and I know I will never be able to pay it back in orider to further my own personal advantage. Kant claims that the universalization of this maxi, results in a contradiction. What does Kant mean?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>Kant means thet we cannot imagine a world where everyone makes deveitful promises, because the practice of promising presupposes trust and no one would trust anyone in a world where everyone makes deceitful promises.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>In Kant&#8217;s time, peasants would sometimes sell their teeth to wealthier individuals who needed them. Kant objected to this, and he would presumably, for similar reasons, object to selling orgrans (like kidneys) in the present day. Which of following most accurate characterizes Kant&#8217;s reasons for objecting to selling part of one&#8217;s body?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>By selling part of her body, a person would be treating herself as a mere means, and not as an end in herself.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Which of the following most accurately expresses Kant&#8217;s view about the relationship between freedom and duty?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>To be truly free, a person must not act on laws that are imposed on her by another, but only on laws that she gives to herself. The moral law is the law that a rational being gives to herself. Therefore, the person who acts from the moral law is tryly free.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Kant offers an example of an honest shopkeeper who refuses to cheat his customers. Kant imagines one motive that the shopkeerper might have: a worry that if he is dishonest, word will get our and he will love business. Why does Kant discuss this example?</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>He want to demonstrate that an honest action can sometimes lack moral worth if it is done from the wrong motive.</p></blockquote>
