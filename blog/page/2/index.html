		<p>Food alone is not enough, you also need an imagined order, but we need one more thing - technique for storing and processing huge amounts of information. After Agricultural Revolution as human societies began to grow larger and larger, who things happened.</p>

<p>First, the amounts of necessary information grew (run village with 5000 people versus band with 50). Second, if you really want to run a big town or kingdom, you need to store and process not only larger amounts of information but also a completely new kinds of infromation, for which the average human brain is ill-adopted - <strong>monotonous mathematical data (numbers)</strong>. Mathematical data is vital (taxes, debt, fines, credit).</p>

<p>Writing is a method for storing and processing information and by using not our neurons in the brain, but by using material signs of all kinds and shapes. Writing was invented not in order to write poetry or philosophy with history because this could be done withour writing. The purpose was to store and process mathematical data for which the Sumerians invented the first script, the first system of writing.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For Freud and Civilization&#8217;s of discontents <strong>guilt is a modern problem</strong>. As we have modernization, as we have a more and more sophisticated society <em>we have a greater and greater chance of the explosion of unsatisfied</em>.</p>

<p>Freud is no friend of anarchism or hypermorality, no friend of socialism, because he thinks all of these are introducing new ideals that will be very difficult to live by.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thus I have not the courage to rise up before my fellow-men as a prophet, and I bow to their reproach that I can offer them no consolation: for at bottom that is what they are demanding - the wildest revolutionaries no less passionately than the most virtuous believers. Civilization and Its Discontents</p></blockquote>

<p>Freud wants to escape the pursuit of meaning through ideals. He doesn&#8217;t want us to strive to live on a plain that is divorced from our animal natures, divorced from instinct. He doesn&#8217;t want us to try to find a mode of consolation that obscures who we are. Because if we obscure who we are, then we create another source of suffering.</p>

<p><em>There is no perfect life for Freud, because there&#8217;s no one good way of living. But we can figure out how to make ourselves suffer less and that would be a significant achievement.</em> All our desires are full of conflict.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Building Pyramids</h2>

<p>Armies, police forces, courts and prisons are ceaselessly at work forcing people to act in accordance with the imagined order. A single priest often does the work of 100 soldiers far more cheaply and effectively. The priest convinces you to really believe this story, and then you don&#8217;t need all the soldiers and police forces to keep you in order. And this was the key for really creating stable social orders.</p>

<p><em>How exactly do you cause people to really believe in an imagined order, such as Christianity, Democracy or Capitalism?</em></p>

<p> Three main factors that prevent people from realizing that the order which organizes their lives and their society exists only in the imagination. We try to link it with the actual material reality which surrounds us.</p>

<p> Many people believe that every human being is an individual whose worth, whose true value does not depent on his or her position in the social hierarchy and does not depend on what other people think about you. The main idea of individualism is that each one os us, have within ourselves some kind of brillian ray of light that gives value and meaning to our lives.</p>

<p>The imagined order also shapes our deepest desires and wishes. Most people do not wish to accept the fact that the order governing their lives is imaginary, because it&#8217;s the imginary order that control and shapes the most fundamental wishes of the people.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Many people today dream about going on vacation to some other country. But there is nothing natural or obvious about this desire. People today spend a great deal of time and effort and money on vacation abroad, because they have programmed by the main stories of their societies to want such things. <strong>People today are true believers in the stories of what scholars call the <em>romantic consumerism</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Romantic consumerism</strong> is one of the most powerful stories today in the world, is a mesh, is a combination between two of the dominant late modern ideologies: <em>romanticism</em> and <em>consumerism</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Romanticism</strong> tells us that in order to make the most of your life, of your human potential, you must have as many different experiences as you can. You must open yourself to a wide spectrum of emotions. You must sample various kinds of relationships. You must try all kinds of different foods. <strong>The best way of doing it is to break free from your daily routine, leave behind your familiar neighborhood and city, and go travel in distant land.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consumerism</strong> tells us that in order to be happy - you must consume as many products and sevices as possible. If you feel what something is missing in your life, then you probably need to buy a new product, like a new car or new clothe. Or you need to buy some kind of service, yoga class or psychologie retreat, but <strong>you need to buy something to be really happy</strong>.</p>

<p>Differenece between realities objective, subjective and inter-subjective.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong> - something that exists independently of human consciousness and of what human believe and invent and tell one another. Example: radio activity - is not a story that people invented and tell one another, existed and influenced people long before anybody knew about it.</p>

<p><strong>Subjective</strong> - is something that exists depending on the consciosness and beliefs of a single individual and it will disappear or change if that particular individual changes his or her beliefs. Exmaple: many children believe in the existence of imaginery friend that only the child himself can see and can talk to. And usually as a child grows up, he stops believing in this imaginary friend.</p>

<p><strong>Inter-subjective</strong> - is something that exists within the communication network that link the subjective consciosness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his/her beliefs or even dies, it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, then the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate and change or completely disappear. Example: Gods, nations, human rights, money, corporations and so on.</p>

		<p>Freud established his credibility as an enlightenment thinker, he goes on to talk about why the only thing you can really look at scienitifcally is the pleasure principle. <strong>Three sources of suffering - own body, the external world and other people</strong>.</p>

<p>He says, so many other writers, whether they&#8217;re religious writers or philosophical writers or politicals, social commentators, what they really want to do is instead of facing what really causes us sorrow, and pain, they want actually to give us consolation (утешение). <strong>Consolation</strong> is not what we should pursue, it is awful thing, because it disguises where our suffering comes from and makes it harder for us to deal with these <strong>sources of suffering</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Life, as we find it, is too hard for us; it brings us too many pains, disappointments and impossible tasks. In order to bear it we cannot dispense with palliative (паллиативный, смягчающий) measures. Civilization and Its Discontents</p></blockquote>

<p>It means we come up with some kind of drugs, so we don&#8217;t have to deal with life as it really is.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230; we cannot fail to be struck by the similarity between the process of civiliation and the libidinal (sexual desire) development of the individual. &#8230; it is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation (formal rejection of something) of instinct, how much it presupposes precisely the non-satisfaction&#8230; of powerful instincts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Every time you have people say, well, love your neighbor, be to strangers, all that, you always find some scapegoat (a person who is blamed for the wrongdoing, mistakes козел отпущения) that you can take your rage out on. Every time you ask people to be sweet and kind as a rule, they will find something to attack.</p>

<blockquote><p>In this respect the Jewish people, scattered everywhere, have rendered the most useful service to the civiliations of the countries that have been their hosts; but unfortunately all the massacres of the Jews in the Middle Ages did not suffice to make that period more peaceful and secure for their Christian fellows. Civilization and Its Discontents.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not only do we find scapegoats out there that we can hate and attack and turn our aggression inward as a result of our guilt. As we become more civilized we have more and more occasions to feel we&#8217;re not living up to our ideals, <strong>become twisted and wracked by guilt, because we&#8217;re not living up to the expectations we&#8217;ve created for ourselves. We&#8217;re not studying enough, we&#8217;re not working hard enought, we&#8217;re not making enought money.</strong></p>

		<h2>Sex, Death, Aggression and Guilt</h2>

<p>Freud is father of psychoanalysis, at the end of the 19th century writing mostly in Vienna. For today we will discuss his work Civilization ands its Discontents.</p>

<p>He focused on this early on in his career, because he felt that the stories he kept hearing from his patients invariably came back to questions of desire. <strong>Free association</strong> that is when the psychoanalysis says &#8220;okay, what&#8217;s the first thing that comes into your mind&#8221; and you say something quickly <strong>before</strong> you have a chance to <strong>censor yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>Before Freud came to that idea of free association, he was a hypnotist.</p>

<p>By the end of 1890 Freud changed his mind about child abusing in families. Instead of thinking these people have been abused, he starts to think, in fact, what people are remembering is their desore. That they can&#8217;t act on.</p>

<p>So Freud starts listining to those stories of thwarted or twisted frustrated desire. And he starts to theorize that what hist patients are suffering from is <strong>the past</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Our hysterical patients suffer from reminiscences. Their symptoms are the remnants and the memory symbols of certain (traumatic) experience. <strong>The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>And by understanding history we have a better chance to live a life that&#8217;s less suffereing and more possibilities for happines and love and work.</p>

<p>Repression is key for Freud because that is the mechanism that explains why you need interpretation. The self is divided in Freud, unlike Rosseau, who thought you have to fight to use the true self hidden under all the disguises. In Freud, the true self is not just one thing, it&#8217;s a contratictory, set of forces and out desires are not uniform, even when we get underneath.</p>

<p>Freud theorizes that as infants, really, as very small children, we begin to look for things to satisfy our elemntal craving Things. But we look for things, that are associated with those elemental cravings and never actually look for the thing that the nourishment (питание, пища, поддержка) that we crave directly.</p>

<p><strong>You continue to search for your fantasies to satisfy your biology.</strong> And when you find something that really does satisfy it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s something you were searching for before. Not the thing itself but something fantastic, some imaginary construct of what you originally biologically instinctively crave.</p>

<blockquote><p>The finding of an object is in fact a refinding of it. Three Essays on the Theory of Secuality</p></blockquote>

<p>He means is when we discover something we really love, we say, gosh I finally found what I really love. It&#8217;s actially some repetition of Something we fantasized about before. Something, that we perhaps, thought we lost before. And, continue to search for things, that are rooted in our histories.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Building Pyramids</h2>

<p>In order to build large cities, kindgoms and empires, more food is of course a necessary condition but it is not a sufficient condition. The mere fact that you can feed 10000 people in the same town or a million doesnt guarantee that they can agree how to divide this food, land and water, how to settle disputes and conflicts. And how to act in times of crisis like drought (засуха) or war.</p>

<p>Sapiens had to rely on <strong>inventing</strong> all kinds of stories, new imagined realities that could regulate cooperation on such a huge scale. Farmers began to weave stories that eventually enable millions of strangers to cooperate together. If we go back to around 8500 BC, we will find that the largest settlements in the world were villages such as <strong>Jercho</strong> which could take a few hundres invidiuals at most. By 3000 BC, you could already find cities and kindoms ruling tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people. And then Roman empire in the Mediterranean region, and the Han empire in China (millions of people). This cities, kindoms and empires were based on the belief on common emergent realities.</p>

<p><strong>Imagined order</strong> - means that the social and legal norms, that sustained these kindoms and empires, and kept their society stable, were base not on some natural instincts and not on personal acquaintance, rather they were based on belief in share stories, shared imagined realities.</p>

<p>We hold these truth to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pusuit of Happiness.</p>

<p>Remix from bilogist point of view:</p>

<p>We hold these truth to be self-evident, that all men are <em>envolved different</em>, that they are <em>born</em> with certain <em>mutable traits</em>, that among these are Life, and the pusuit of <em>Pleasure</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Arguments Markers</h2>

<p><em>I am tall, and I am good at sport.</em></p>

<p>vs</p>

<p><em>I am tall, so I am good at sports.</em></p>

<p>When you use the word <strong>and</strong>, you&#8217;re simply stating the two facts. But when you use the word <strong>so</strong> (therefore, thus, hence, accordingly), you&#8217;re indicating that one of them is a <em>reson</em> for the other.</p>

<p>Kinds of argument markers:</p>

<p>Conclusion markers: <strong>so, therefore, thus, accordingly</strong>, they indicate that the sentece right after them is a conclusion.</p>

<p>After the words <strong>because, for, as, for the reason that, and the reason why</strong> are a reason or a premise. And we going to call it a reason marker, or a premise marker.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Arguments are made of language. Rational animal, the animal that reasons. Humans are the only one that argues and reasons in this sense.</p>

<p>Language is:</p>

<ol>
<li>important</li>
<li>conventional</li>
<li>representational</li>
<li>social</li>
</ol>


<p>Language cannot change the facts of the world.</p>

<p>Referential of Descriptive view of Language. But how about &#8220;Hello&#8221; or &#8220;Not&#8221;? Do it reffer to something? So many words don&#8217;t fit this referential or descriptive theory of meaning.</p>

<blockquote><p>Meaning is use. Ludwig Wittgenstain</p></blockquote>

<p>Three levels of language:</p>

<ol>
<li>Linguistic - meaningful utterance, producing a meaningful utterance.</li>
<li>Speech - advising is a nice paradigm of that, which can be accomplished even if you&#8217;re not persuaded it.</li>
<li>Conversational - persuading.</li>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>History&#8217;s biggest fraud</h2>

<p>First theory: The process of domestication of animals may have begin with selective hunting.</p>

<p>Second theory: When hunters caught and adopted a little lamb, fattening it for some weeks or months when there was plenty of food and they killed and ate it.</p>

<p>Domesticatated animals also spread around the world with people.</p>

<p>10 000 years there are not more than a few million sheep, a few million cattle, goats, pigs and chicken and that they are mostly restricted to to certain area in Afro-Asia.</p>

<p>Today in contrast, the world contains about <strong>1 billion sheep, 1 billion pigs, 1.5 cattle, 25 billion chickens.</strong> So for a narrow evolutionaty perspective, which measures the success of a species by the number of DNA copies the agrocultural revolution was a wonderful success for checkens and cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.</p>

<p>Farmers in certain societies in New Guinea, what they did is to slice off, to cut a part of the nose of the pig. And this causes the pig a severe pain whenever he tries to sniff around.</p>

<p>Cows, goats and sheep produce milk only after they give birth to caives and kids and lambs. And only as long as these youngsters are suckling because the milk of cows, it is meant to feed the children of the cow. In order to ensure continues supply of animal milk, a farmer need all the time to have cows and kids and little lambs for suckling.</p>

<p><strong>Agrocultural revolution was a huge success from the point of evolutionary proccess, but it was catastrophe for cows, chickens and pigs as individuals.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>Strong arguments don&#8217;t always persuade everyone</h2>

<p>Religious and cultural beliefs can be too hard to overcome. So even the best arguments can have disbelievers. Human beings aren&#8217;t always logical and don&#8217;t always believe scientifically proven cause and effect.</p>

<p>A valid, strong and sound argument in and of itself may never persuade or convert anyone to adpt a different way of thinking. So what. What a strong argument does is to communicate clearly what one think and why they think it.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t set your sights too high. If your goal is to persuade everybody, you&#8217;re going to be <strong>constantly frustrated</strong>.</p>

<h2>What else Arguments used for? Explanation</h2>

<p>You can use Arguments in order to explain things. <strong>Explaining</strong> is gigivng a reason why something happened (or why it is true).</p>

<p>When you justify something, your audience <strong>might not believe</strong> what you are justifying.</p>

<p>When you explain something, you and your audience both <strong>believe</strong> what you are explaining.</p>

<blockquote><p>The goal of explanation is to help people understan why something is true.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kinds of Explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Causal</strong>: <em>Why did the bridge collapse? The earthquake shook it.</em></li>
<li><strong>Teleological</strong> (purpose): <em>Why did Joe go to the grocery store? To buy milk.</em></li>
<li><strong>Formal</strong>: <em>Why doesn&#8217;t this peg fit in that round hole? The peg is square.</em></li>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: <em>Why is this golf club light? It is made of graphite.</em></li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In this part we&#8217;re going to talk about the question why people move towards wheat? It&#8217;s not offer people economic security, not good for the diet, because has less mineral and vitamins, hard to digest and bad for our teeth. The life of a peasant is usually less secure than the life of a hunter gatherer, they gather, hunt and eat a lot of of different food.</p>

<p>Chance of the men to die at the hand of another man was 25% in ancient agricultural village say 8 000 years ago. Today in the world it&#8217;s about 1.5% - 1%, even less.</p>

<p>Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory for a given field. Homo sapiens <strong>could get much more food if we used agriculture than if we hunted and gather what frows naturally in that field.</strong> Extra food enable the number of Sapiens to grow exponentially.</p>

<p><em>Evolutionary success of a specie is measured only by the number of copies of DNA in existence.</em> Because of extra food, villages and connection to the one place woman could have a child every year instead of having baby just every three or four years as was the case with hunter gatherers (woman were very careful to wait until the previous child could walk before having another baby).</p>

<p>Moreover, infectious diseases began to spread rapidly (from domesticated animals to people, problems with toilet and garbage piles, diet was worse and immune system was less robust)</p>

<p>Population kept growing and growing all the time, and therefore, even if people wanted to go back from agruculture back to the hunting and gathering, they can&#8217;t because they have much more people to feed. So they kept watering the wheat firlds and feeding all &#8220;extra&#8221; people.</p>

<p><strong>The disire to have a better and easier life actually treapped human kind in harder living conditions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Luxuries tend to become necessities.</strong> Once people get used to a certain habit, they begin to count on it and to take it for granted and eventually they reach the position when they can&#8217;t live without it.</p>

<p>Example with email vs post mail. It obviously very good and easy to be able to send something and get response very fast versus sending the message with envelope and stamps on it and get the answer in weeks or even month. The life of people who use emails is not more easy and more relaxed than the life of people who used only letters.
Humanity search for an easier life, releases immense forces of change which tranform the world in ways that nobody envisioned or wanted. It&#8217;s extremely difficult to foresee all the results of our actions and all the factors which in order to make really good decisions, we need to tak into account.</p>

<p>Alternative explanation about agricultural revolution. It suggests that what brought about the agricultural revolution was not the search for an easier and more comfortable life, rather, it was the attempt to fulfil some kind of cultural or religious aspiration.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What are Arguments used for?</h2>

<p><strong>Persuading</strong> is making people believe or do something that they would not otherwise believe or do.</p>

<p><strong>Justifying</strong> is showing someone a reason to believe the conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Justification</strong> tries to give good reasons. <strong>Persuasion</strong> tries to change your belief or actions (and bad reasons can do that).</p>

<p>When someone give you an argument, you need to ask a series of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the arguer trying to <strong>change</strong> someone&#8217;s mind? If so, the purpose is <strong>persuasion</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the arguer trying to give some kind of <strong>reason</strong> to believe something? If so, the purpose is <strong>justification</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

		<p>Ecological disaster. In part two we&#8217;re talking about America. Part I was about ecological disaster in Australia. They come to American from Sibiria to Alaska without significant genetic mutation and evolution.</p>

<h2>History&#8217;s Biggest Fraud</h2>

<p>If things were so good at the time of the hunter gatherers, why did the agricultural revolution happen?</p>

<p>For the first 2.5 millin years of their existence, human managed very well without agriculture. They fed themselves by gathering plant and by hunting animals that lived and bread <strong>without</strong> much human intervention.</p>

<p>About <strong>12 000 years ago</strong> sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to manipulate the lives of a few animal and plant species. Like wheat or potatoes or chicken or cows, from sunrise to sunset, sewed seeds and watered plants, and plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to pasture.</p>

<p>That leads to the agricultural revolution, transition from a life of hunting and gathering to a life of controlling and cultivation plants and animals ofccured for the first time around <strong>9000 BC</strong> in southeastern Turkey, western Iran and Levant (scholars once believed that agriculture began only this area in the Middle East and from there spread all around the world, but this theory is <strong>no longer accepted</strong>. Today scholars agree, that agriculture sprang up in several different parts of the world independently).</p>

<p>Agricultural revoltion was a great leap forward for human kind. It&#8217;s wrong to think that the agricultural revoltion began because people became smarter and discovered things about animals and plants that they didn&#8217;t know before.</p>

<p>Compared with lives of most peasants, the ancient hunter gatherers enjoyed a better life, they enjoyed a healthier diet, they worked fewer hours and they spent their time doing much more interesting things than the peasants. Also they were less in danger of starvation, of disease and probably even less in danger of human violence.</p>

<p>The average peasant in the small village, he or she worked harder than the average forager thousands of years prevously. And they got in return a worse diet. <em>The agricultural revolution from this prospective turns out to be the biggest fraud in history.</em></p>

<p>Meat covers almost 2.25 million square km of the globe&#8217;s surface. How did it turn wheat from being insignificant to be ubiquitous, everywhere? <strong>Wheat did it by manipulating homo sapiens!</strong></p>

<p>The human body is not adapted to all this back breaking toil, to all this clearing rocks and weeding of fields and carrying water buckets from the river. Human body paid for all this effort with a very high price.</p>

<p>Also, people were forced to settle permanently next to the wheat field and this completely changed their way of life. From nomadic foragers, human turned into peasants living in a village in one place. <strong>Wheat domisticated us</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Paintings. We&#8217;re starting off with Eugene Delacroix was born just after the French Revolution in 1798 and he lives on to 1863.</p>

<p>Art should lead to heightened emotion within a bourgeois sphere, middle class sphere.</p>

<hr />

<h2>ThinkAgain</h2>

<p>Professor name is Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. He going to teach me how to reason and argue. Think more deeply. We going approach reason by <strong>arguments, because arguments are just ways to express reasons.</strong> And if you can understand arguments, you can understand reason.</p>

<p>Good Arguments => Good Reason for the ways which you think and behave.</p>

<p>Understand arguments helps to avoid mistakes.</p>

<ol>
<li>How to analyze arguments (which passages includes arguments)</li>
<li>How to evaluate deductive arguments (propositional and categorical logic)</li>
<li>How to evaluate inductive arguments (generalization, application, inference to the best explanation, causal reasoning, decision making)</li>
<li>How to avoid fallacies (vagueness неопределенность, ambiguity, irrelevance, begging the question)</li>
</ol>


<p>You can&#8217;t win an argument just by <strong>yelling</strong> at someone. That doesn&#8217;t make the argument any better because that&#8217;s not the point of arguing.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t win an argument simply by <strong>calling your opponent a stupid git</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Complainings</strong> just  expressing your emotion about the situation.</p>

<p><strong>An argument</strong> is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition. Sometimes arguments are intended to stablish a propostion, but in other cases they&#8217;re intended to help us understand the proposition and the reasons why the proposition is true.</p>

<p><strong>Argument:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>a series of sentences, statements, or propositions</li>
<li>where some are the premises</li>
<li>and one is the conclusion</li>
<li>where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion.</li>
</ol>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Facing up to the reality of the pleasures we get from suffering from cruelty, actually opens up the horizon for us. Shame, he thinks, is a great inhibitor on intensity.</p>

<blockquote><p>What really arouses indignation (возмущение) against suffering is not suffering as such but the senselessness of suffering&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>When we are violate the moral law we are in debt, we create a debt and we have to pay back and this society becomes our creditor. And so the question becomes for Nietzsche, <strong>how do we burn in the sense that I owe something to society, to my community because I have violated its rules?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Morality is just a cover that the weak use to protect themselves against the strong.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Today it is impossible to say clearly why we really have punishment - all ideas in which an entire process is semiotically summarized elude (ускользать) definition - <strong>only something which has no history is capable of being defined.</strong></p>

<p>All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward - this is what I call the internalization of man: thus it was that man first developed what was later called his &#8216;soul&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>By denying our instincts to act, to be cruel, to break out of our conventions we force them into other cavities, other channels.</p>

<p>Morality becomes a kind of self-torture.</p>

<blockquote><p>He sees in &#8216;God&#8217; the ultimate antithesis of his own ineluctable animal instincts; he reinterprets these very animal instincts as a form of guilt against God: this thought becomes a form of torture to him.</p>

<p>But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? &#8230; We modern men are the heirs of the conscience-vivisection and self-torture of millenia&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nietzche want to liberate us from our morality and from our pursuit of foundations. He want to have us realize that the things we&#8217;re taught that are most precious are actually symptoms of our fear of our own strength.</p>

<hr />

<h1>The Human Flood</h1>

<p>How sapiens related to other animals and plants. The first breakout from the inner world of Afro-Asia to the outer occurred about 45 000 years ago in Australia. How could sapiense from Asia reach Australia about 45 000 years ago? (we found bones and sapiens tools there). They learned how to build an maneuver ocean going vessels and became fishermen, long distance explorer and traders.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Morality of Suicide and Course Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Morality is always about how I treat others, it&#8217;s not about how I treat myself. And if we accept that claim we can say that the right to life only covers how I treat others.</p>

<p>When I kill myself I&#8217;m doing it for my own sake. That seems highly relevant in thinking about the morality of suicide. You might think that the relevance of saying that I&#8217;m harming mysqlf for my own sake is this. If I&#8217;m harming myself for my own sake, what I&#8217;m saying is, despite the fact that I&#8217;m harming mysqlf, I&#8217;m better off.
When I kill myself, given that I&#8217;m doing it for my own benefit, I&#8217;ve obviously got my own agreement. I can&#8217;t kill myself agains my will. That seems pretty important. Consent can make it acceptable to do to someone what would normally be wrong in the absence of their consent.</p>

<p>Boxing is moraly acceptable. But I can&#8217;t hit someone without concent. Consent makes it legitimate to harm people.</p>

<p>Suicide isn&#8217;t always legitimate, but it&#8217;s sometimes legitimate.</p>

<p>Face death without fear and without illusion.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/09/08/september-08-sunday/">[Death] Suicide. Part 2. [Modernart] From Struggle to Intensity. Part 5</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Deciding under Uncertainty</h1>

<p>At what point would it be true that suicide might be rational?</p>

<p>Burn with great deal of pain while their skin regragrafted and the life. And early on in that period, this person said, although he believed that he&#8217;d eventually recover, what he was going to have to go through was so horrible that he wished he were dead.</p>

<h2>Case of Illness</h2>

<p>Since you never know for sure that you won&#8217;t recover, since there&#8217;s always a possibility pf recovery, suicide never makes sense. After all, we all know that there&#8217;s constant progress in medicine, people are always making breakthroughs and what seems like an incurable disease one day may have some sort of cure the next. But <strong>if you killed youself, you&#8217;ve thrown away any chance</strong> of getting that cure. But it seems wrong!</p>

<p><strong>Morality of Suicide</strong>. Theological theory restrict suicide, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Struggle to Intensity</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Every art, every philosophy may be viewed as an aid and remedy in the service of growing and striving life: they always presuppose suffering and sufferers. On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge philosophy how it help to be more alive. Suffering is part of the proccess of invigoration (укрепления).</p>

<p><strong>Ressentiment</strong> - is shows us what you can call a dynamic of reversal. Once upon of time in ancient days there was no moral distinction between good and evel. There was just distinction between good and bad. What makes me feel weak is evel and suddenly the weak person says, all those strong people, those blond beasts, the popular kids, the folks who seem to have it all, those are <strong>evil</strong>. Why? Because they have it all and I don&#8217;t have it. They&#8217;re evel, because they have what it takes to be successfull to dominate others.</p>

<p>The moral distrinction comes from the weak trying to denigrate (порочить) the powerful. <strong>Morality</strong> for Nietzsche is the way the weak protect themselves against strength.</p>

<blockquote><p>To demand that strength does not express itself as strength, that it must not consist of a will to overpower, a will to throw down, a will to rule, a thirst for enemies and opposition and triump - that is as unreasonable as to demand that weakness express itself as strength.</p>

<p>If forgetfulness (забывчивость) were not present, there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no hoping, no pride, no present. The man in whom this repression apparatus is harmed and not working properly we can compare to a dyspeptic ( and not just compare ) - he is &#8216;finished&#8217; with nothing. On the Genealogy of Morals</p></blockquote>

<p>Panishment makes the human animal rememer these values. Suffering goes together with morality, because when we have moral values, we want to see those who violate those values suffer. And suffering, he thinks, is the underbelly of morality.</p>

<blockquote><p>To see others suffer does one good, to make others suffer even more: this is a hard saying, but an acient, mighty, human, all-too-human principle to which even the apes might subscribe&#8230; Without cruelty there is no festival&#8230;</p></blockquote>
