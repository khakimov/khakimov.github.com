		<p>Facing up to the reality of the pleasures we get from suffering from cruelty, actually opens up the horizon for us. Shame, he thinks, is a great inhibitor on intensity.</p>

<blockquote><p>What really arouses indignation (возмущение) against suffering is not suffering as such but the senselessness of suffering&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>When we are violate the moral law we are in debt, we create a debt and we have to pay back and this society becomes our creditor. And so the question becomes for Nietzsche, <strong>how do we burn in the sense that I owe something to society, to my community because I have violated its rules?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Morality is just a cover that the weak use to protect themselves against the strong.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Today it is impossible to say clearly why we really have punishment - all ideas in which an entire process is semiotically summarized elude (ускользать) definition - <strong>only something which has no history is capable of being defined.</strong></p>

<p>All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward - this is what I call the internalization of man: thus it was that man first developed what was later called his &#8216;soul&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>By denying our instincts to act, to be cruel, to break out of our conventions we force them into other cavities, other channels.</p>

<p>Morality becomes a kind of self-torture.</p>

<blockquote><p>He sees in &#8216;God&#8217; the ultimate antithesis of his own ineluctable animal instincts; he reinterprets these very animal instincts as a form of guilt against God: this thought becomes a form of torture to him.</p>

<p>But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? &#8230; We modern men are the heirs of the conscience-vivisection and self-torture of millenia&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nietzche want to liberate us from our morality and from our pursuit of foundations. He want to have us realize that the things we&#8217;re taught that are most precious are actually symptoms of our fear of our own strength.</p>

<hr />

<h1>The Human Flood</h1>

<p>How sapiens related to other animals and plants. The first breakout from the inner world of Afro-Asia to the outer occurred about 45 000 years ago in Australia. How could sapiense from Asia reach Australia about 45 000 years ago? (we found bones and sapiens tools there). They learned how to build an maneuver ocean going vessels and became fishermen, long distance explorer and traders.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Morality of Suicide and Course Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Morality is always about how I treat others, it&#8217;s not about how I treat myself. And if we accept that claim we can say that the right to life only covers how I treat others.</p>

<p>When I kill myself I&#8217;m doing it for my own sake. That seems highly relevant in thinking about the morality of suicide. You might think that the relevance of saying that I&#8217;m harming mysqlf for my own sake is this. If I&#8217;m harming myself for my own sake, what I&#8217;m saying is, despite the fact that I&#8217;m harming mysqlf, I&#8217;m better off.
When I kill myself, given that I&#8217;m doing it for my own benefit, I&#8217;ve obviously got my own agreement. I can&#8217;t kill myself agains my will. That seems pretty important. Consent can make it acceptable to do to someone what would normally be wrong in the absence of their consent.</p>

<p>Boxing is moraly acceptable. But I can&#8217;t hit someone without concent. Consent makes it legitimate to harm people.</p>

<p>Suicide isn&#8217;t always legitimate, but it&#8217;s sometimes legitimate.</p>

<p>Face death without fear and without illusion.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/09/08/september-08-sunday/">[Death] Suicide. Part 2. [Modernart] From Struggle to Intensity. Part 5</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Deciding under Uncertainty</h1>

<p>At what point would it be true that suicide might be rational?</p>

<p>Burn with great deal of pain while their skin regragrafted and the life. And early on in that period, this person said, although he believed that he&#8217;d eventually recover, what he was going to have to go through was so horrible that he wished he were dead.</p>

<h2>Case of Illness</h2>

<p>Since you never know for sure that you won&#8217;t recover, since there&#8217;s always a possibility pf recovery, suicide never makes sense. After all, we all know that there&#8217;s constant progress in medicine, people are always making breakthroughs and what seems like an incurable disease one day may have some sort of cure the next. But <strong>if you killed youself, you&#8217;ve thrown away any chance</strong> of getting that cure. But it seems wrong!</p>

<p><strong>Morality of Suicide</strong>. Theological theory restrict suicide, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Struggle to Intensity</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Every art, every philosophy may be viewed as an aid and remedy in the service of growing and striving life: they always presuppose suffering and sufferers. On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge philosophy how it help to be more alive. Suffering is part of the proccess of invigoration (укрепления).</p>

<p><strong>Ressentiment</strong> - is shows us what you can call a dynamic of reversal. Once upon of time in ancient days there was no moral distinction between good and evel. There was just distinction between good and bad. What makes me feel weak is evel and suddenly the weak person says, all those strong people, those blond beasts, the popular kids, the folks who seem to have it all, those are <strong>evil</strong>. Why? Because they have it all and I don&#8217;t have it. They&#8217;re evel, because they have what it takes to be successfull to dominate others.</p>

<p>The moral distrinction comes from the weak trying to denigrate (порочить) the powerful. <strong>Morality</strong> for Nietzsche is the way the weak protect themselves against strength.</p>

<blockquote><p>To demand that strength does not express itself as strength, that it must not consist of a will to overpower, a will to throw down, a will to rule, a thirst for enemies and opposition and triump - that is as unreasonable as to demand that weakness express itself as strength.</p>

<p>If forgetfulness (забывчивость) were not present, there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no hoping, no pride, no present. The man in whom this repression apparatus is harmed and not working properly we can compare to a dyspeptic ( and not just compare ) - he is &#8216;finished&#8217; with nothing. On the Genealogy of Morals</p></blockquote>

<p>Panishment makes the human animal rememer these values. Suffering goes together with morality, because when we have moral values, we want to see those who violate those values suffer. And suffering, he thinks, is the underbelly of morality.</p>

<blockquote><p>To see others suffer does one good, to make others suffer even more: this is a hard saying, but an acient, mighty, human, all-too-human principle to which even the apes might subscribe&#8230; Without cruelty there is no festival&#8230;</p></blockquote>

		<p>Animistic believes. Animism (anima) - is the belief that the world is full of animated beings. All of whom can communicate with one another directly. Animist could believe that big rock at the top of the hill has feeling, desires and needs. But the world is also full of all kinds of immaterial beings, immaterial anima which you can talk with. Animists believe that there is no barrier between humans and other beings. <strong>Animism - it&#8217;s not a specific religion or belive.</strong></p>

<p>Theis - all believe in great gods.</p>

<hr />

<h1>From struggle to intensity</h1>

<p>With Friedrich Nietzsche who is in many ways the anti-modern modern, like Rousseau was a anti-enlightenment enlightenment figure.
Rousseau - <em>man is born free and is everywhere in chains</em>. Arts and sciences putting flowers over the chains with which we are laden.</p>

<p>Marx - <em>the history of all hitherto existing societies, the history of class struggle.</em></p>

<p>Nietzsche - <em>God is dead</em>. It means for Nietzsche there is no ideal, there is no standard, no end point, no divinity, no forms, no numinal, no History. Nothing that we can meauser ourselves in our creations.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Intensity replaces morality. Baudelaire and Nietzsche whose work becomes very important for post-modernism much later, they reject the hierarchies that had governed ethics, politics and aesthetics. And in so doing, developed a framework for making poetry and philosophy, respectively. Shoot the clock and let&#8217;s see the world without an expectation that you have to be somewhere else soon.</p>

<p>French revolution 1848. 1853 to 1870 Paris became a new kind of place. New kinds of lighs, which illuminate the boulevard. New kinds of people you see all the time. That becomes the material for Baudelaire poetry.</p>

<p>Two terms to keep in mind - <strong>flaneur</strong> and <strong>dandy</strong>. Dandy - a man unduly devoted to style, neatness, and fashion in dress and appearance. Public presentation of difference, of exaggerated willingness, even desire to be seen. The dandy wants to be seen.</p>

<p>Bohemians are the ones who are living in a garret, living the life on the margins. They&#8217;re not just poor, they&#8217;re living in poverty, because they think poverty is an escape from bourgeois convention. And Baudelaire as a poet vacillates between the dandy and the Bohemian.</p>

<p><strong>Bohemian</strong> - a person, as an artist or writer, who lives and acts free of regard for conventional rules and practices.</p>

<p>They both anti-conventinal.</p>

<p><strong>Flaneurs</strong> - strolls around without purpose, moving through the city streets without going to a particular place. They&#8217;re open to possibility. You don&#8217;t know what youre going to run into. <strong>Most of us living in situations where we constrict the possibility in favor of security or convention.</strong> You see the people you want to see, segregation insures that in many places in this country and abroad, segregation by class, by race, by gender sometimes.</p>

<p>Anythin that you can do to pursue intensity might lead actually to real poetry or real art.</p>

<hr />

<h1>The Rationality of Suicide</h1>

<p>We face the possibility to end our life earlier than it would end otherwise. Two-state requirements not met, because death is not the state. You can make assumption based on before and after, because it is no after at all. But in the same case with two-state requirements we can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s better to be alive then.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Daily life in the stone age</h1>

<p>Lived in small band (at most several hundreds). The dog was the first animal that homosapiens domesticated (15 000 years ago dogs were already part of human bands).</p>

<p>Trade some luxury items, kind of political things about others band, they also celebrated some religious events.</p>

<p>They lived in constant movement, from one place to another place, in search of food. Influenced by animals and birds migration winter and summer time, also follow cycles of growth plants.</p>

<p>Fishing villages might have appeared on the coast of Indonesia around 45 000 years ago.</p>

<p>35-45 hours each week, it was enought to go hunting one day out of three days.</p>

<p>Missunderstanding stats about average life cycle about 35-40, but it&#8217;s because childbirth deaths.</p>

<p>Better nutrition.</p>

<li>deadlift</li>
<li>standing military press</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>How?</strong> Take 80%-85% of your supposed max and perfom as many reps ass possible. Then plug the reps and the weight into this formula to get your estimated 1RM:</p>

<p><strong>Weight * Reps * 0.0333 + Weight = Estimated 1RM</strong></p>

<p>Take 90% of this number and use this as your &#8221;<em>max</em>&#8221; for the <strong>first 4 weeks of the training cycle</strong>. For example, let&#8217;s say I have a 300 deadlift, 220 squat, 180 bench press and 100 military press, then my numbers would look like this:</p>

<p>Deadlift: 300 * 0.9 = 270
Squat: 220 * 0.9 = 198
Bench: 180 * 0.9 = 162
Military press: 100 * 0.9 = 90</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Darwin understands the variations are transmitted and controlled through the breeding process and he understands that in nature something like that process takes place too.</p>

<p>The human race is not the goal of evolution, it is one of the products of evolution. The tree of evolution, Darwin says, and is without a trunk.</p>

<blockquote><p>How fleeting are the wishes and effors of man! How short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder, then, that nature&#8217;s productions should be far &#8216;truer&#8217; in character than man&#8217;s productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship? On the Origin of Species</p></blockquote>

<p>Biogeography
Paleontology - geologic periods
Embryology - embryonic development
Morphology - studies the form and structure of something without consideration of the function.</p>

<blockquote><p>In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.</p>

<p>Darwinian selection theory is a two-step process - the production of variation unrelated to the adaptive requirements of the organism, and differential perpetuation of those variations that serve adaptive needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Intelligence is in a adaprive byproduct of evolution. Intelligence was on of those variations that get perpetuated because it helped in the struggle to survive. Morality is an adaptive change through the advantages of living together. Sexual selection depends not on the struggle for existence, but on the struggle between males for the possession of the females.</p>

<blockquote><p>I fully admin that it is atonishing that the females of many birds and some mammals should be endowed with sufficient taste to appreciate ornaments, which we have reason to attribute to sexual selection; and this is even more astonishing in the case of reptiles, fish and insects. The Descent of Man</p>

<p>We thus learn that man is descended from a hairy, tailed quadruped, probably arboreal in its habits, and an inhabitant of the Old World. The Descent Of Man</p></blockquote>

<p>The truth is a compliment you give to the ideas you like. DeGrody</p>

<hr />

<p>Homo sapience is able to change it&#8217;s social, economic, and political behavior very rapidly. Bonobo (dominated by females) and Common Chimpanze (dominated by Alpha Male).</p>

<p>Three teories what happened with Cognitive Revolution starts 70 000 years ago:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>About people being able to share more information about the outside world. About lions, rivers, plan and carry out all kinds of complex actions such as avoiding lion or hunting bison.</p></li>
<li><p>Gossip. Transfer a lot of information not about lions, but about sapiense and the social relationship between Sapiens. It enable Sapiense to live in larger and more cohesive groups up to about 150 individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiction and fiction language. Ability to transmit large quantites of information about things that don&#8217;t really exist at all, like tribal spirits and ghosts. Opens the way for cooperation between very large numbers of strangers. Also it opened the way to the rapid innovation of social behavior.</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Evolutionaty Psychology</h1>

<p><strong>Eating habit.</strong> Obisity results from the conditions under which our ancestors lived 30 or 40 or 50 thousands years ago and their complecated interaction between those conditions and the situation today. 50000 years ago if a woman was walking along the savanna, and suddenly seeing a tree full of ripened fruit, the most sensible thing to do back then was to eat as many of these fruits as quickly as possible for two reasons. First of all <strong>sweet things, things with a lot of sugar in them were very rare in the savannah 50 000 years ago</strong> and the second reason is because somebody else will eat it, so better to it as many of them as possible.</p>

<p>My DNA and psychological urges tell me the same way as my grate parents 50 000 years reacted in the savannah.</p>

<p>Women could have relation with several man and same for man. And no concept marriage for life. Commune raised the childrens.</p>

<p>Collective fatherhood - child could have more than one father.</p>

<hr />

<p>How should we live? We could do it wrong. Mortality rubs our chance do-over.</p>

<p>We have to be careful in our aims and we have to be careful in our execution of our aims, because we have a rather limited amount of time to do it over.</p>

<p>We just don&#8217;t have enought time to flail around, try a little of this, try a little of that. And so what death forces us to do is to be careful. <strong>The face about our death requires paying attention.</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I&#8217;m paying attention, so what should I do with my life? What should I fill it with? What kinds of contents should we try to fill our lives with?</p>

<p>Strategy number one says given that you&#8217;ve only got a finite amount of time, pack as much as you can into life. Given the dangers of failure if you aim too ambitiously, you should settle for the kinds of goals that you&#8217;ve virtually guaranteed that you&#8217;ll accomplish. The pleasure of food, company, sex, ice cream. Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.</p>

<p>Strategy number two says that&#8217;s all well and good, you&#8217;ve got a pretty high chance of succeeding at that. The trouble with strategy number one is the goods that you can achive are small. You might want to write a novel, compose a symphony or marry and raise a family.</p>

<p>Grant me but one good summer, you Powerful Ones!
   And but one autumn, ripening for my song,</p>

<pre><code>  So that my heart, fulfilled by sweet play, 
     Might the more willingly die, contented.
</code></pre>

<p>The soul deprived in life of its godly right
   Won’t rest in Orcus, either, not down below,</p>

<pre><code>  Yet if the sacred boon my heart craves 
     Should in the future succeed—the poem—
</code></pre>

<p>Welcome, then, silence, hail to the world of shades!
   I’ll rest content, even if my lyre and play</p>

<pre><code>  Did not conduct me down there; once I
     Lived as the gods live, and more we don’t need.
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m just deluding myself as well, when I think there&#8217;s something grander, something signigicant, something valuable about having made an accomplishment, having achieved something that continues beyond me.</p>

<p>We live and then we&#8217;re dead is to try to make the life that you&#8217;ve got as good as possible, as valuable as possible, to pack as much into it as you can.</p>

<p><strong>Life is Suffering</strong> - if life isn&#8217;t worth having overall, then its loss is not a bad thing, but a good thing. The trick isn&#8217;t to make life as valuable as it could be, but rather to come to recognize that on balance, life isn&#8217;t positive, but negative.</p>

<p>Buddhist believe if you think hard about the underlying nature of life, you&#8217;ll see that everyplace there is loss. <strong>Life is suffering.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>The legend of Peugeot company</strong> What is it? Maybe you can say it is cars that Peugeot manufactories, but it seems wrong because Peugeot company is not the same as the Peugeot cars. Maybe you can say it is factories and showrooms, but it is not. So perhaps Peugeot is the people who work in the factories and in the offices? It&#8217;s clearly not true. Peugeot is a story, it is a fiction, something that we invented, it belongs to a particular kind of fictions which is called limited liability companies.</p>

<p>Hoc est corpus meum. (this is my body)</p>

<p>How to convince millions of people, strangers to one another to believe the same stories about gods or about limited liability companies or about nations or about human rights? It helps sapiens to manage millions of strangers to cooperate towards common goals.</p>

<p><strong>Imagined reality</strong> is something that everybody believes in and as long as this common belief persists, the imagined reality is a real force in the world.</p>

<p>Dual reality - on the on hand there is the objective reality of revirs and trees and lions, on the other hand there is the imagined reality of gods and nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became more and more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers and trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as goods and nations and corporations.</p>

<h1>Charles Darwin</h1>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s difficult to believe in the dreadful but quiet war lurking just below the serene facade of nature. Charles Darwin, 1839</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Utilitarianism</strong> it&#8217;s the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong&#8230;</p>

<p>Romanticism versus Utalitarianism. For romantics we make the world as we live in it.</p>

<p>Joshua Mill said that romanticism saved him. Joshua Mill was a prodigy child, he learned Greek by the age of three, high level mathematics by four or five, various languages and then he had a nervous breakdown, he has crisis.</p>

<p>You can do what you want as long as it doesn&#8217;t hurt someone else. This notion of liberty is key for modern political thought</p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose that all your objects in life were realized&#8230; would this be a joy and happiness to you? And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered &#8220;No!&#8221; At this my heart sank within me; the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down. John Stuart Mill, Autobiography</p></blockquote>

<p>And then he read about melancholy and dejection, and he says, these people know about life. They don&#8217;t say oh, you should flip a coin or go and take a class. These people actually explore their experience of sadness as a way of deepening their lives and creating art. And Mill wanted to create a bridge between utilitarianism and this romanticism. And the rest of his life he focused on building a philosophy that combines attention to utility, attention to calculation, but also attention to organic community, attention to the whole.</p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s problem. Why is there variety? Species are not permanent. Darwin went to investigate nature, he says, I&#8217;ve got to look, and I&#8217;ve got to collect. He went on famous voyage on the ship Beagles, from 1831 to 1836.</p>

<blockquote><p>This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a flucuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic. On the Origin of Species</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Origin of Species</strong> is published in 1859.</p>

<h1>Fear of Death</h1>

<p>In what circumstances, or in what ways, should we behave one way rather than another? Kafka, for example, said the meaning of life is the fact that it ends. Cryptic, as usually for Kafka, but suggestion, is a fairly common one, it&#8217;s something deep about how we should live, that we&#8217;re going to die, that our life will come to an end. How should we respond to that fact?</p>

<p>Emotional response. Fear. Terror of death. Is fear of death a rationally appropriate response? resonable emotion?</p>

<p>Under what conditions does it make sense to be proud of something? First of all, the thing that you&#8217;re proud of has to be some kind of accomplishment. Something that it makes sense for you to be proud of it, it&#8217;s got to be in some way an accomplishment that reflects well on you.</p>

<p>Conditions number <strong>one</strong> - in order to feel <strong>fear</strong> it has to <strong>be bad</strong>. Fear requires something bad, as the object of your fear. Conditions number <strong>two</strong> - there&#8217;s should be nonnegligible chance of the bad state of affairs happening, <strong>of the bad object coming to you</strong>. Fear by mauled to death by tigers doesn&#8217;t make any sense.
Conditions number three - we need to have a cerain amount of uncertainty in order to have fear be appropriate. Where the bad thing will occur and/or how bad the bad thing will be.</p>

<p>First thing you might worry about the death is the process of dying. Then afraid just being dead, but it&#8217;s not appropriate in that case because you&#8217;re guaranteed that you&#8217;re going to die and this is not nonegligible chance. Is being dead intrinsically a bad thing? It doesn&#8217;t seem to me that it is. The only thing you could be afraid of is that you might die too soon, earlier rather than later.</p>

<p>Maybe <strong>anger</strong> is appropriate response? Anger itself has appropriateness conditions. In order for anger to make sense, well, here&#8217;s condition that make sense.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s got to be directed at a person. It has control over whatever he/she doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Anger makes sense only when the agent has wronged you, has treated you in a way that it was morally inappropriate in a way to treat you. If your rommate has been doing things that you don&#8217;t like, but they haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, anger doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe I should just be sad at the fact that I&#8217;m going to die to soon and some emotions does make sense. The world&#8217;s a wonderful place and it would be better to have more of it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s extraordinarily lucky of us to be in this select, fortunate few. Not fear, not anger, we need to be gradidute to be alive at all.</p>

<p>Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s book - Cat&#8217;s Cradle</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/2013/08/23/august-23-friday/">[Death] Other Bad Aspects of Death</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you did know how much time left to live, how would you act differently from what you&#8217;re doing now? Would it focus your attention on making sure you did the things that were most important to you?</p>

<p>To find the most valuable thing in life ask the question what would you choose to do if you knew you had five years, ten years, what have you?</p>

<p>The possibility of death is ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Examples about values in the life. My two favorite foods in the world are probably pizza on the one hand and chocolate on the other. If you combaine it into pizza with chocolate top just sounds disgusting. But it&#8217;s not bad if you think about pizza in isolation and chocolate in isolation. So, same concept to think about death following the life.</p>

<p>Negative <strong>Taste is just a tease and how the noble have fallen</strong> on the one hand.</p>

<p>Positive <strong>the extra preciousness of life</strong></p>

<p><strong>Should we be thinking about death at all?</strong> The appropriate way to live gets shaped, at least in part, by the fact that we&#8217;re going to die, that we won&#8217;t be around forever.</p>

<p>The facts about death, if I thought about them, would change my begavior, but not because it would give me a reason to change my behavior - simply because it would influence my behavior. So, better to not think about them (not think about death)</p>

		<h1>Modern Art</h1>

<p>Contant with wealth had laid someting over it that would not be wiped away.</p>

<blockquote><p>Passion does not make verses; and the more personal you are, the weaker&#8230; The less you feel a thing, the more capable you are of expression it as it is&#8230;</p>

<p>To have talent, you must be convinced that you possess it; and to keep your conscience pure you must set it above everybody else&#8217;s. The way to live serenely, in clean, fresh air, is to install youself on some pyramid, no matter which, provided it be lofty and have a solid foundation. Ah! It isn&#8217;t always &#8216;amusing&#8217; up there, and you are absolutely alone; but there is some consalation in spitting from so high a place.</p></blockquote>

<p>The realy real for Flaubert is art.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the best form in which to express on&#8217;s opinion&#8230; about the affairs of this world without risking being taken later for a fool? It&#8217;s a difficult problem. It seems to me that the best way is simply to depict things that exasperate you. Dissection is revenge.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Human Kind</h1>

<p>Human history is about 70 000 years.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cofgnitive revolution 70 000 years ago</li>
<li>Agroculture revolution 12 000 years ago</li>
<li>The scientific revolution 500 years ago</li>
</ol>


<p>Human brain is about 1200 - 1400 cm3. 2% of the weight, and 25% energy of the body. Shimpanze is five times stronger then a human being weighing a equal weight of 60 kg.</p>

<p>But we don&#8217;t know yet what drives to grow big brain.</p>

<p>2.5 millions years ago the first time of making and using tools.</p>

<p>Human children born prematurely, half baked (story about moving from using legs and hands for walking to just legs. and brain became bigger and it was harder to give a birth, birth chanel was smaller and smaller because legs become closer and closer for better walking perfomance)</p>

<p>Human niche had a speciality in nature, which was to eat marrow inside bones.</p>

<p>Only 100 000 years ago human moved from the middle to the top preditors in the world and foot chain.</p>
