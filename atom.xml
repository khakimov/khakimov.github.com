    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>History&#8217;s biggest fraud</h2>

<p>First theory: The process of domestication of animals may have begin with selective hunting.</p>

<p>Second theory: When hunters caught and adopted a little lamb, fattening it for some weeks or months when there was plenty of food and they killed and ate it.</p>

<p>Domesticatated animals also spread around the world with people.</p>

<p>10 000 years there are not more than a few million sheep, a few million cattle, goats, pigs and chicken and that they are mostly restricted to to certain area in Afro-Asia.</p>

<p>Today in contrast, the world contains about <strong>1 billion sheep, 1 billion pigs, 1.5 cattle, 25 billion chickens.</strong> So for a narrow evolutionaty perspective, which measures the success of a species by the number of DNA copies the agrocultural revolution was a wonderful success for checkens and cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.</p>

<p>Farmers in certain societies in New Guinea, what they did is to slice off, to cut a part of the nose of the pig. And this causes the pig a severe pain whenever he tries to sniff around.</p>

<p>Cows, goats and sheep produce milk only after they give birth to caives and kids and lambs. And only as long as these youngsters are suckling because the milk of cows, it is meant to feed the children of the cow. In order to ensure continues supply of animal milk, a farmer need all the time to have cows and kids and little lambs for suckling.</p>

<p><strong>Agrocultural revolution was a huge success from the point of evolutionary proccess, but it was catastrophe for cows, chickens and pigs as individuals.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>Strong arguments don&#8217;t always persuade everyone</h2>

<p>Religious and cultural beliefs can be too hard to overcome. So even the best arguments can have disbelievers. Human beings aren&#8217;t always logical and don&#8217;t always believe scientifically proven cause and effect.</p>

<p>A valid, strong and sound argument in and of itself may never persuade or convert anyone to adpt a different way of thinking. So what. What a strong argument does is to communicate clearly what one think and why they think it.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t set your sights too high. If your goal is to persuade everybody, you&#8217;re going to be <strong>constantly frustrated</strong>.</p>

<h2>What else Arguments used for? Explanation</h2>

<p>You can use Arguments in order to explain things. <strong>Explaining</strong> is gigivng a reason why something happened (or why it is true).</p>

<p>When you justify something, your audience <strong>might not believe</strong> what you are justifying.</p>

<p>When you explain something, you and your audience both <strong>believe</strong> what you are explaining.</p>

<blockquote><p>The goal of explanation is to help people understan why something is true.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kinds of Explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Causal</strong>: <em>Why did the bridge collapse? The earthquake shook it.</em></li>
<li><strong>Teleological</strong> (purpose): <em>Why did Joe go to the grocery store? To buy milk.</em></li>
<li><strong>Formal</strong>: <em>Why doesn&#8217;t this peg fit in that round hole? The peg is square.</em></li>
<li><strong>Material</strong>: <em>Why is this golf club light? It is made of graphite.</em></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this part we&#8217;re going to talk about the question why people move towards wheat? It&#8217;s not offer people economic security, not good for the diet, because has less mineral and vitamins, hard to digest and bad for our teeth. The life of a peasant is usually less secure than the life of a hunter gatherer, they gather, hunt and eat a lot of of different food.</p>

<p>Chance of the men to die at the hand of another man was 25% in ancient agricultural village say 8 000 years ago. Today in the world it&#8217;s about 1.5% - 1%, even less.</p>

<p>Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory for a given field. Homo sapiens <strong>could get much more food if we used agriculture than if we hunted and gather what frows naturally in that field.</strong> Extra food enable the number of Sapiens to grow exponentially.</p>

<p><em>Evolutionary success of a specie is measured only by the number of copies of DNA in existence.</em> Because of extra food, villages and connection to the one place woman could have a child every year instead of having baby just every three or four years as was the case with hunter gatherers (woman were very careful to wait until the previous child could walk before having another baby).</p>

<p>Moreover, infectious diseases began to spread rapidly (from domesticated animals to people, problems with toilet and garbage piles, diet was worse and immune system was less robust)</p>

<p>Population kept growing and growing all the time, and therefore, even if people wanted to go back from agruculture back to the hunting and gathering, they can&#8217;t because they have much more people to feed. So they kept watering the wheat firlds and feeding all &#8220;extra&#8221; people.</p>

<p><strong>The disire to have a better and easier life actually treapped human kind in harder living conditions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Luxuries tend to become necessities.</strong> Once people get used to a certain habit, they begin to count on it and to take it for granted and eventually they reach the position when they can&#8217;t live without it.</p>

<p>Example with email vs post mail. It obviously very good and easy to be able to send something and get response very fast versus sending the message with envelope and stamps on it and get the answer in weeks or even month. The life of people who use emails is not more easy and more relaxed than the life of people who used only letters.
Humanity search for an easier life, releases immense forces of change which tranform the world in ways that nobody envisioned or wanted. It&#8217;s extremely difficult to foresee all the results of our actions and all the factors which in order to make really good decisions, we need to tak into account.</p>

<p>Alternative explanation about agricultural revolution. It suggests that what brought about the agricultural revolution was not the search for an easier and more comfortable life, rather, it was the attempt to fulfil some kind of cultural or religious aspiration.</p>

<hr />

<h2>What are Arguments used for?</h2>

<p><strong>Persuading</strong> is making people believe or do something that they would not otherwise believe or do.</p>

<p><strong>Justifying</strong> is showing someone a reason to believe the conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Justification</strong> tries to give good reasons. <strong>Persuasion</strong> tries to change your belief or actions (and bad reasons can do that).</p>

<p>When someone give you an argument, you need to ask a series of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the arguer trying to <strong>change</strong> someone&#8217;s mind? If so, the purpose is <strong>persuasion</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the arguer trying to give some kind of <strong>reason</strong> to believe something? If so, the purpose is <strong>justification</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ecological disaster. In part two we&#8217;re talking about America. Part I was about ecological disaster in Australia. They come to American from Sibiria to Alaska without significant genetic mutation and evolution.</p>

<h2>History&#8217;s Biggest Fraud</h2>

<p>If things were so good at the time of the hunter gatherers, why did the agricultural revolution happen?</p>

<p>For the first 2.5 millin years of their existence, human managed very well without agriculture. They fed themselves by gathering plant and by hunting animals that lived and bread <strong>without</strong> much human intervention.</p>

<p>About <strong>12 000 years ago</strong> sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to manipulate the lives of a few animal and plant species. Like wheat or potatoes or chicken or cows, from sunrise to sunset, sewed seeds and watered plants, and plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to pasture.</p>

<p>That leads to the agricultural revolution, transition from a life of hunting and gathering to a life of controlling and cultivation plants and animals ofccured for the first time around <strong>9000 BC</strong> in southeastern Turkey, western Iran and Levant (scholars once believed that agriculture began only this area in the Middle East and from there spread all around the world, but this theory is <strong>no longer accepted</strong>. Today scholars agree, that agriculture sprang up in several different parts of the world independently).</p>

<p>Agricultural revoltion was a great leap forward for human kind. It&#8217;s wrong to think that the agricultural revoltion began because people became smarter and discovered things about animals and plants that they didn&#8217;t know before.</p>

<p>Compared with lives of most peasants, the ancient hunter gatherers enjoyed a better life, they enjoyed a healthier diet, they worked fewer hours and they spent their time doing much more interesting things than the peasants. Also they were less in danger of starvation, of disease and probably even less in danger of human violence.</p>

<p>The average peasant in the small village, he or she worked harder than the average forager thousands of years prevously. And they got in return a worse diet. <em>The agricultural revolution from this prospective turns out to be the biggest fraud in history.</em></p>

<p>Meat covers almost 2.25 million square km of the globe&#8217;s surface. How did it turn wheat from being insignificant to be ubiquitous, everywhere? <strong>Wheat did it by manipulating homo sapiens!</strong></p>

<p>The human body is not adapted to all this back breaking toil, to all this clearing rocks and weeding of fields and carrying water buckets from the river. Human body paid for all this effort with a very high price.</p>

<p>Also, people were forced to settle permanently next to the wheat field and this completely changed their way of life. From nomadic foragers, human turned into peasants living in a village in one place. <strong>Wheat domisticated us</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Paintings. We&#8217;re starting off with Eugene Delacroix was born just after the French Revolution in 1798 and he lives on to 1863.</p>

<p>Art should lead to heightened emotion within a bourgeois sphere, middle class sphere.</p>

<hr />

<h2>ThinkAgain</h2>

<p>Professor name is Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. He going to teach me how to reason and argue. Think more deeply. We going approach reason by <strong>arguments, because arguments are just ways to express reasons.</strong> And if you can understand arguments, you can understand reason.</p>

<p>Good Arguments => Good Reason for the ways which you think and behave.</p>

<p>Understand arguments helps to avoid mistakes.</p>

<ol>
<li>How to analyze arguments (which passages includes arguments)</li>
<li>How to evaluate deductive arguments (propositional and categorical logic)</li>
<li>How to evaluate inductive arguments (generalization, application, inference to the best explanation, causal reasoning, decision making)</li>
<li>How to avoid fallacies (vagueness неопределенность, ambiguity, irrelevance, begging the question)</li>
</ol>


<p>You can&#8217;t win an argument just by <strong>yelling</strong> at someone. That doesn&#8217;t make the argument any better because that&#8217;s not the point of arguing.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t win an argument simply by <strong>calling your opponent a stupid git</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Complainings</strong> just  expressing your emotion about the situation.</p>

<p><strong>An argument</strong> is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition. Sometimes arguments are intended to stablish a propostion, but in other cases they&#8217;re intended to help us understand the proposition and the reasons why the proposition is true.</p>

<p><strong>Argument:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>a series of sentences, statements, or propositions</li>
<li>where some are the premises</li>
<li>and one is the conclusion</li>
<li>where the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facing up to the reality of the pleasures we get from suffering from cruelty, actually opens up the horizon for us. Shame, he thinks, is a great inhibitor on intensity.</p>

<blockquote><p>What really arouses indignation (возмущение) against suffering is not suffering as such but the senselessness of suffering&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>When we are violate the moral law we are in debt, we create a debt and we have to pay back and this society becomes our creditor. And so the question becomes for Nietzsche, <strong>how do we burn in the sense that I owe something to society, to my community because I have violated its rules?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Morality is just a cover that the weak use to protect themselves against the strong.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Today it is impossible to say clearly why we really have punishment - all ideas in which an entire process is semiotically summarized elude (ускользать) definition - <strong>only something which has no history is capable of being defined.</strong></p>

<p>All instincts that do not discharge themselves outwardly turn inward - this is what I call the internalization of man: thus it was that man first developed what was later called his &#8216;soul&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>By denying our instincts to act, to be cruel, to break out of our conventions we force them into other cavities, other channels.</p>

<p>Morality becomes a kind of self-torture.</p>

<blockquote><p>He sees in &#8216;God&#8217; the ultimate antithesis of his own ineluctable animal instincts; he reinterprets these very animal instincts as a form of guilt against God: this thought becomes a form of torture to him.</p>

<p>But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? &#8230; We modern men are the heirs of the conscience-vivisection and self-torture of millenia&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nietzche want to liberate us from our morality and from our pursuit of foundations. He want to have us realize that the things we&#8217;re taught that are most precious are actually symptoms of our fear of our own strength.</p>

<hr />

<h1>The Human Flood</h1>

<p>How sapiens related to other animals and plants. The first breakout from the inner world of Afro-Asia to the outer occurred about 45 000 years ago in Australia. How could sapiense from Asia reach Australia about 45 000 years ago? (we found bones and sapiens tools there). They learned how to build an maneuver ocean going vessels and became fishermen, long distance explorer and traders.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Morality of Suicide and Course Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Morality is always about how I treat others, it&#8217;s not about how I treat myself. And if we accept that claim we can say that the right to life only covers how I treat others.</p>

<p>When I kill myself I&#8217;m doing it for my own sake. That seems highly relevant in thinking about the morality of suicide. You might think that the relevance of saying that I&#8217;m harming mysqlf for my own sake is this. If I&#8217;m harming myself for my own sake, what I&#8217;m saying is, despite the fact that I&#8217;m harming mysqlf, I&#8217;m better off.
When I kill myself, given that I&#8217;m doing it for my own benefit, I&#8217;ve obviously got my own agreement. I can&#8217;t kill myself agains my will. That seems pretty important. Consent can make it acceptable to do to someone what would normally be wrong in the absence of their consent.</p>

<p>Boxing is moraly acceptable. But I can&#8217;t hit someone without concent. Consent makes it legitimate to harm people.</p>

<p>Suicide isn&#8217;t always legitimate, but it&#8217;s sometimes legitimate.</p>

<p>Face death without fear and without illusion.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Deciding under Uncertainty</h1>

<p>At what point would it be true that suicide might be rational?</p>

<p>Burn with great deal of pain while their skin regragrafted and the life. And early on in that period, this person said, although he believed that he&#8217;d eventually recover, what he was going to have to go through was so horrible that he wished he were dead.</p>

<h2>Case of Illness</h2>

<p>Since you never know for sure that you won&#8217;t recover, since there&#8217;s always a possibility pf recovery, suicide never makes sense. After all, we all know that there&#8217;s constant progress in medicine, people are always making breakthroughs and what seems like an incurable disease one day may have some sort of cure the next. But <strong>if you killed youself, you&#8217;ve thrown away any chance</strong> of getting that cure. But it seems wrong!</p>

<p><strong>Morality of Suicide</strong>. Theological theory restrict suicide, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Struggle to Intensity</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Every art, every philosophy may be viewed as an aid and remedy in the service of growing and striving life: they always presuppose suffering and sufferers. On the Genealogy of Morals (1887)</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge philosophy how it help to be more alive. Suffering is part of the proccess of invigoration (укрепления).</p>

<p><strong>Ressentiment</strong> - is shows us what you can call a dynamic of reversal. Once upon of time in ancient days there was no moral distinction between good and evel. There was just distinction between good and bad. What makes me feel weak is evel and suddenly the weak person says, all those strong people, those blond beasts, the popular kids, the folks who seem to have it all, those are <strong>evil</strong>. Why? Because they have it all and I don&#8217;t have it. They&#8217;re evel, because they have what it takes to be successfull to dominate others.</p>

<p>The moral distrinction comes from the weak trying to denigrate (порочить) the powerful. <strong>Morality</strong> for Nietzsche is the way the weak protect themselves against strength.</p>

<blockquote><p>To demand that strength does not express itself as strength, that it must not consist of a will to overpower, a will to throw down, a will to rule, a thirst for enemies and opposition and triump - that is as unreasonable as to demand that weakness express itself as strength.</p>

<p>If forgetfulness (забывчивость) were not present, there could be no happiness, no cheerfulness, no hoping, no pride, no present. The man in whom this repression apparatus is harmed and not working properly we can compare to a dyspeptic ( and not just compare ) - he is &#8216;finished&#8217; with nothing. On the Genealogy of Morals</p></blockquote>

<p>Panishment makes the human animal rememer these values. Suffering goes together with morality, because when we have moral values, we want to see those who violate those values suffer. And suffering, he thinks, is the underbelly of morality.</p>

<blockquote><p>To see others suffer does one good, to make others suffer even more: this is a hard saying, but an acient, mighty, human, all-too-human principle to which even the apes might subscribe&#8230; Without cruelty there is no festival&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<h1>From struggle to intensity</h1>

<p>With Friedrich Nietzsche who is in many ways the anti-modern modern, like Rousseau was a anti-enlightenment enlightenment figure.
Rousseau - <em>man is born free and is everywhere in chains</em>. Arts and sciences putting flowers over the chains with which we are laden.</p>

<p>Marx - <em>the history of all hitherto existing societies, the history of class struggle.</em></p>

<p>Nietzsche - <em>God is dead</em>. It means for Nietzsche there is no ideal, there is no standard, no end point, no divinity, no forms, no numinal, no History. Nothing that we can meauser ourselves in our creations.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Intensity replaces morality. Baudelaire and Nietzsche whose work becomes very important for post-modernism much later, they reject the hierarchies that had governed ethics, politics and aesthetics. And in so doing, developed a framework for making poetry and philosophy, respectively. Shoot the clock and let&#8217;s see the world without an expectation that you have to be somewhere else soon.</p>

<p>French revolution 1848. 1853 to 1870 Paris became a new kind of place. New kinds of lighs, which illuminate the boulevard. New kinds of people you see all the time. That becomes the material for Baudelaire poetry.</p>

<p>Two terms to keep in mind - <strong>flaneur</strong> and <strong>dandy</strong>. Dandy - a man unduly devoted to style, neatness, and fashion in dress and appearance. Public presentation of difference, of exaggerated willingness, even desire to be seen. The dandy wants to be seen.</p>

<p>Bohemians are the ones who are living in a garret, living the life on the margins. They&#8217;re not just poor, they&#8217;re living in poverty, because they think poverty is an escape from bourgeois convention. And Baudelaire as a poet vacillates between the dandy and the Bohemian.</p>

<p><strong>Bohemian</strong> - a person, as an artist or writer, who lives and acts free of regard for conventional rules and practices.</p>

<p>They both anti-conventinal.</p>

<p><strong>Flaneurs</strong> - strolls around without purpose, moving through the city streets without going to a particular place. They&#8217;re open to possibility. You don&#8217;t know what youre going to run into. <strong>Most of us living in situations where we constrict the possibility in favor of security or convention.</strong> You see the people you want to see, segregation insures that in many places in this country and abroad, segregation by class, by race, by gender sometimes.</p>

<p>Anythin that you can do to pursue intensity might lead actually to real poetry or real art.</p>

<hr />

<h1>The Rationality of Suicide</h1>

<p>We face the possibility to end our life earlier than it would end otherwise. Two-state requirements not met, because death is not the state. You can make assumption based on before and after, because it is no after at all. But in the same case with two-state requirements we can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s better to be alive then.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Daily life in the stone age</h1>

<p>Lived in small band (at most several hundreds). The dog was the first animal that homosapiens domesticated (15 000 years ago dogs were already part of human bands).</p>

<p>Trade some luxury items, kind of political things about others band, they also celebrated some religious events.</p>

<p>They lived in constant movement, from one place to another place, in search of food. Influenced by animals and birds migration winter and summer time, also follow cycles of growth plants.</p>

<p>Fishing villages might have appeared on the coast of Indonesia around 45 000 years ago.</p>

<p>35-45 hours each week, it was enought to go hunting one day out of three days.</p>

<p>Missunderstanding stats about average life cycle about 35-40, but it&#8217;s because childbirth deaths.</p>

<li>deadlift</li>
<li>standing military press</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>How?</strong> Take 80%-85% of your supposed max and perfom as many reps ass possible. Then plug the reps and the weight into this formula to get your estimated 1RM:</p>

<p><strong>Weight * Reps * 0.0333 + Weight = Estimated 1RM</strong></p>

<p>Take 90% of this number and use this as your &#8221;<em>max</em>&#8221; for the <strong>first 4 weeks of the training cycle</strong>. For example, let&#8217;s say I have a 300 deadlift, 220 squat, 180 bench press and 100 military press, then my numbers would look like this:</p>

<p>Deadlift: 300 * 0.9 = 270
Squat: 220 * 0.9 = 198
Bench: 180 * 0.9 = 162
Military press: 100 * 0.9 = 90</p>

<h1>Week 1</h1>

<p>65% * 5 reps, 75% * 5 reps, 85% * 5 or more reps</p>

<h1>Week 2</h1>

<p>70% * 3 reps, 80% * 3 reps, 90% * 3 or more reps</p>

<h1>Week 3</h1>

<p>75% * 5 reps, 85% * 3 reps, 95% * 1 or more reps</p>

<h1>Week 4</h1>

<p>40% * 5 reps, 50% * 5 reps, 65% * 5</p>

<h1>Warming up</h1>

<p>1 * 5 40%
1 * 5 50%
1 * 3 60%
Worksets</p>

<hr />

<p>When you get sick, go on vacation, etc what to do?</p>

<ul>
<li>start where you left off and only get prescribed reps.</li>
<li>do the deload week first to get back into the swing of things</li>
</ul>


<p>What to do if you miss a training day?</p>

<ul>
<li>just pick up where you left off.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Darwin understands the variations are transmitted and controlled through the breeding process and he understands that in nature something like that process takes place too.</p>

<p>The human race is not the goal of evolution, it is one of the products of evolution. The tree of evolution, Darwin says, and is without a trunk.</p>

<blockquote><p>How fleeting are the wishes and effors of man! How short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder, then, that nature&#8217;s productions should be far &#8216;truer&#8217; in character than man&#8217;s productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship? On the Origin of Species</p></blockquote>

<p>Biogeography
Paleontology - geologic periods
Embryology - embryonic development
Morphology - studies the form and structure of something without consideration of the function.</p>

<blockquote><p>In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.</p>

<p>Darwinian selection theory is a two-step process - the production of variation unrelated to the adaptive requirements of the organism, and differential perpetuation of those variations that serve adaptive needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Intelligence is in a adaprive byproduct of evolution. Intelligence was on of those variations that get perpetuated because it helped in the struggle to survive. Morality is an adaptive change through the advantages of living together. Sexual selection depends not on the struggle for existence, but on the struggle between males for the possession of the females.</p>

<blockquote><p>I fully admin that it is atonishing that the females of many birds and some mammals should be endowed with sufficient taste to appreciate ornaments, which we have reason to attribute to sexual selection; and this is even more astonishing in the case of reptiles, fish and insects. The Descent of Man</p>

<p>We thus learn that man is descended from a hairy, tailed quadruped, probably arboreal in its habits, and an inhabitant of the Old World. The Descent Of Man</p></blockquote>

<p>The truth is a compliment you give to the ideas you like. DeGrody</p>

<hr />

<p>Homo sapience is able to change it&#8217;s social, economic, and political behavior very rapidly. Bonobo (dominated by females) and Common Chimpanze (dominated by Alpha Male).</p>

<p>Three teories what happened with Cognitive Revolution starts 70 000 years ago:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>About people being able to share more information about the outside world. About lions, rivers, plan and carry out all kinds of complex actions such as avoiding lion or hunting bison.</p></li>
<li><p>Gossip. Transfer a lot of information not about lions, but about sapiense and the social relationship between Sapiens. It enable Sapiense to live in larger and more cohesive groups up to about 150 individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Fiction and fiction language. Ability to transmit large quantites of information about things that don&#8217;t really exist at all, like tribal spirits and ghosts. Opens the way for cooperation between very large numbers of strangers. Also it opened the way to the rapid innovation of social behavior.</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Evolutionaty Psychology</h1>

<p><strong>Eating habit.</strong> Obisity results from the conditions under which our ancestors lived 30 or 40 or 50 thousands years ago and their complecated interaction between those conditions and the situation today. 50000 years ago if a woman was walking along the savanna, and suddenly seeing a tree full of ripened fruit, the most sensible thing to do back then was to eat as many of these fruits as quickly as possible for two reasons. First of all <strong>sweet things, things with a lot of sugar in them were very rare in the savannah 50 000 years ago</strong> and the second reason is because somebody else will eat it, so better to it as many of them as possible.</p>

<p>My DNA and psychological urges tell me the same way as my grate parents 50 000 years reacted in the savannah.</p>

<p>Women could have relation with several man and same for man. And no concept marriage for life. Commune raised the childrens.</p>

<p>Collective fatherhood - child could have more than one father.</p>

<hr />

<p>How should we live? We could do it wrong. Mortality rubs our chance do-over.</p>

<p>We have to be careful in our aims and we have to be careful in our execution of our aims, because we have a rather limited amount of time to do it over.</p>

<p>We just don&#8217;t have enought time to flail around, try a little of this, try a little of that. And so what death forces us to do is to be careful. <strong>The face about our death requires paying attention.</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I&#8217;m paying attention, so what should I do with my life? What should I fill it with? What kinds of contents should we try to fill our lives with?</p>

<p>Strategy number one says given that you&#8217;ve only got a finite amount of time, pack as much as you can into life. Given the dangers of failure if you aim too ambitiously, you should settle for the kinds of goals that you&#8217;ve virtually guaranteed that you&#8217;ll accomplish. The pleasure of food, company, sex, ice cream. Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.</p>

<p>Strategy number two says that&#8217;s all well and good, you&#8217;ve got a pretty high chance of succeeding at that. The trouble with strategy number one is the goods that you can achive are small. You might want to write a novel, compose a symphony or marry and raise a family.</p>

<p>Grant me but one good summer, you Powerful Ones!
   And but one autumn, ripening for my song,</p>

<pre><code>  So that my heart, fulfilled by sweet play, 
     Might the more willingly die, contented.
</code></pre>

<p>The soul deprived in life of its godly right
   Won’t rest in Orcus, either, not down below,</p>

<pre><code>  Yet if the sacred boon my heart craves 
     Should in the future succeed—the poem—
</code></pre>

<p>Welcome, then, silence, hail to the world of shades!
   I’ll rest content, even if my lyre and play</p>

<pre><code>  Did not conduct me down there; once I
     Lived as the gods live, and more we don’t need.
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m just deluding myself as well, when I think there&#8217;s something grander, something signigicant, something valuable about having made an accomplishment, having achieved something that continues beyond me.</p>

<p>We live and then we&#8217;re dead is to try to make the life that you&#8217;ve got as good as possible, as valuable as possible, to pack as much into it as you can.</p>

<p><strong>Life is Suffering</strong> - if life isn&#8217;t worth having overall, then its loss is not a bad thing, but a good thing. The trick isn&#8217;t to make life as valuable as it could be, but rather to come to recognize that on balance, life isn&#8217;t positive, but negative.</p>

<p>Buddhist believe if you think hard about the underlying nature of life, you&#8217;ll see that everyplace there is loss. <strong>Life is suffering.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>The legend of Peugeot company</strong> What is it? Maybe you can say it is cars that Peugeot manufactories, but it seems wrong because Peugeot company is not the same as the Peugeot cars. Maybe you can say it is factories and showrooms, but it is not. So perhaps Peugeot is the people who work in the factories and in the offices? It&#8217;s clearly not true. Peugeot is a story, it is a fiction, something that we invented, it belongs to a particular kind of fictions which is called limited liability companies.</p>

<p>Hoc est corpus meum. (this is my body)</p>

<p>How to convince millions of people, strangers to one another to believe the same stories about gods or about limited liability companies or about nations or about human rights? It helps sapiens to manage millions of strangers to cooperate towards common goals.</p>

<p><strong>Imagined reality</strong> is something that everybody believes in and as long as this common belief persists, the imagined reality is a real force in the world.</p>

<p>Dual reality - on the on hand there is the objective reality of revirs and trees and lions, on the other hand there is the imagined reality of gods and nations and corporations. As time went by, the imagined reality became more and more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers and trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as goods and nations and corporations.</p>

<h1>Charles Darwin</h1>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s difficult to believe in the dreadful but quiet war lurking just below the serene facade of nature. Charles Darwin, 1839</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Utilitarianism</strong> it&#8217;s the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong&#8230;</p>

<p>Romanticism versus Utalitarianism. For romantics we make the world as we live in it.</p>

<p>Joshua Mill said that romanticism saved him. Joshua Mill was a prodigy child, he learned Greek by the age of three, high level mathematics by four or five, various languages and then he had a nervous breakdown, he has crisis.</p>

<p>You can do what you want as long as it doesn&#8217;t hurt someone else. This notion of liberty is key for modern political thought</p>

<blockquote><p>Suppose that all your objects in life were realized&#8230; would this be a joy and happiness to you? And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered &#8220;No!&#8221; At this my heart sank within me; the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down. John Stuart Mill, Autobiography</p></blockquote>

<p>And then he read about melancholy and dejection, and he says, these people know about life. They don&#8217;t say oh, you should flip a coin or go and take a class. These people actually explore their experience of sadness as a way of deepening their lives and creating art. And Mill wanted to create a bridge between utilitarianism and this romanticism. And the rest of his life he focused on building a philosophy that combines attention to utility, attention to calculation, but also attention to organic community, attention to the whole.</p>

<p>Darwin&#8217;s problem. Why is there variety? Species are not permanent. Darwin went to investigate nature, he says, I&#8217;ve got to look, and I&#8217;ve got to collect. He went on famous voyage on the ship Beagles, from 1831 to 1836.</p>

<blockquote><p>This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a flucuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic. On the Origin of Species</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Origin of Species</strong> is published in 1859.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Fear of Death</h1>

<p>In what circumstances, or in what ways, should we behave one way rather than another? Kafka, for example, said the meaning of life is the fact that it ends. Cryptic, as usually for Kafka, but suggestion, is a fairly common one, it&#8217;s something deep about how we should live, that we&#8217;re going to die, that our life will come to an end. How should we respond to that fact?</p>

<p>Emotional response. Fear. Terror of death. Is fear of death a rationally appropriate response? resonable emotion?</p>

<p>Under what conditions does it make sense to be proud of something? First of all, the thing that you&#8217;re proud of has to be some kind of accomplishment. Something that it makes sense for you to be proud of it, it&#8217;s got to be in some way an accomplishment that reflects well on you.</p>

<p>Conditions number <strong>one</strong> - in order to feel <strong>fear</strong> it has to <strong>be bad</strong>. Fear requires something bad, as the object of your fear. Conditions number <strong>two</strong> - there&#8217;s should be nonnegligible chance of the bad state of affairs happening, <strong>of the bad object coming to you</strong>. Fear by mauled to death by tigers doesn&#8217;t make any sense.
Conditions number three - we need to have a cerain amount of uncertainty in order to have fear be appropriate. Where the bad thing will occur and/or how bad the bad thing will be.</p>

<p>First thing you might worry about the death is the process of dying. Then afraid just being dead, but it&#8217;s not appropriate in that case because you&#8217;re guaranteed that you&#8217;re going to die and this is not nonegligible chance. Is being dead intrinsically a bad thing? It doesn&#8217;t seem to me that it is. The only thing you could be afraid of is that you might die too soon, earlier rather than later.</p>

<p>Maybe <strong>anger</strong> is appropriate response? Anger itself has appropriateness conditions. In order for anger to make sense, well, here&#8217;s condition that make sense.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s got to be directed at a person. It has control over whatever he/she doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Anger makes sense only when the agent has wronged you, has treated you in a way that it was morally inappropriate in a way to treat you. If your rommate has been doing things that you don&#8217;t like, but they haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, anger doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Maybe I should just be sad at the fact that I&#8217;m going to die to soon and some emotions does make sense. The world&#8217;s a wonderful place and it would be better to have more of it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s extraordinarily lucky of us to be in this select, fortunate few. Not fear, not anger, we need to be gradidute to be alive at all.</p>

<p>Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s book - Cat&#8217;s Cradle</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you did know how much time left to live, how would you act differently from what you&#8217;re doing now? Would it focus your attention on making sure you did the things that were most important to you?</p>

<p>To find the most valuable thing in life ask the question what would you choose to do if you knew you had five years, ten years, what have you?</p>

<p>The possibility of death is ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Examples about values in the life. My two favorite foods in the world are probably pizza on the one hand and chocolate on the other. If you combaine it into pizza with chocolate top just sounds disgusting. But it&#8217;s not bad if you think about pizza in isolation and chocolate in isolation. So, same concept to think about death following the life.</p>

<p>Negative <strong>Taste is just a tease and how the noble have fallen</strong> on the one hand.</p>

<p>Positive <strong>the extra preciousness of life</strong></p>

<p><strong>Should we be thinking about death at all?</strong> The appropriate way to live gets shaped, at least in part, by the fact that we&#8217;re going to die, that we won&#8217;t be around forever.</p>

<p>The facts about death, if I thought about them, would change my begavior, but not because it would give me a reason to change my behavior - simply because it would influence my behavior. So, better to not think about them (not think about death)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When people think they are going beyond the common place, that&#8217;s the time to really be suspicious. Romantism rejected mechanistic approach to happines or to pleasure. <strong>The Romantics</strong> value emotions, they value conflict, interested in nature as a scene of turbulence, they value authenticity, a kind of deep honesty and an expression of the soul and the arts, very importantly. Flaubert understands romanticism inside out, but he rejects it. He thinks it leads to <strong>stupidity and cliche</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Those who were beginning to age had a youthful look, while a touch of maturity overlay the faces of the younger. In their indiferent gazes floated the tranquility of passions daily gratified, and beneath their gentle manners was visible that particular brutality imparted by domination in rather easy things, in which one&#8217;s strength is exerted and one&#8217;s vanity tickled - the handling of thoroughbred hourses and the company of fallen women.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>How good is your life? Add up your experiences and your accomplishments and the particular details of your life as what the story is about. Being alive per se it has no value. Life itself is a container which we fill with various goods or bads. And deciding how valuable it is, how good it is for me to be alive is a matter of adding up the value of the contents of the life. <strong>But the container itself is a mere container. It has no value in and of itself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Neutrual container theory</strong> - only about pain and pleasure, mere container is a neutral.</p>

<p><strong>Valuable container theory</strong> - Life itself is worth having. There&#8217;s benefit to me above and beyond the question of what&#8217;s going on within my life (am I loved, am I accomplishing things, am I having nice experiences or not) but we need to remember mere fact that I&#8217;m alive gives my life some value.</p>

<p>How much extra add valueble container? Modest versions of the valuable container theory say, although being alive per se is good, if the contents of your life get bad enought, that <strong>can outweigh the value of being alive</strong> so that the grand total is negative.</p>

<p>Against it thinks being alive per se is so incredibly valuable that no matter how horrible the contents are, the <strong>grand total will always be positive</strong>. (fantastic valuable container theory)</p>

<p>The centrual bad thing about to die is the fact that because I&#8217;ll be dead I&#8217;ll be deprived of the good things in life. This is not the only bad thing, there are other features of death, as we experience it, that are separable from the deprivation account.</p>

<p>If we see it can not go any other way we don&#8217;t have to feel bad about it. 2 + 2 always equal 4. Spinoza.</p>

<p>would it be better to know when you were going to die? Because of unpredictability it&#8217;s difficult to make right kinds of plans. And in particular, it&#8217;s hard to know how to pace youself. It can work the other way as well, you make a life plan and then you don&#8217;t die yet, you continue to stick around and then your life has this feeling anticlimitic.</p>

<p>The overall shape of you life matters (the narrative arc of your life)</p>

<h1>The Value of Life</h1>

<p>Example with rat and orgasmic impulse, when they stop eat and having sex except but clicking button with this impulses. Why we could not imagine doing same thing with us? <strong>There&#8217;s something that distinguishes humans from rats.</strong> No doubt you would enjoy it for a very long time. But I imagine that after a period, part of you is going to start asking, &#8220;Huh, say, it feels the same as it was yesterday and the day before that and the day before that.&#8221; I imagine this is how it&#8217;s going to feel tomorrow, and the day after that and the day after that. And eventually this question would start, <strong>&#8220;is this really all there is to life, just simple pleasure like this?&#8221;</strong> You are not just going to stay caught in the moment. You&#8217;re going to take this meta-level or higher level standpoint, look down at the pleasure and wonder, &#8220;Is this all that there is to life?&#8221; and this question will override the pleasure, <strong>eventually, you&#8217;d become hirrified that you were, in effect, stuck in this rat-like existence.</strong></p>

<p>Immortality can&#8217;t be something desirable, it would be a nightmare, something you would long to free yourself from.</p>

<p>So parhaps the best form of life would be not immortality; and not what we&#8217;ve got now, where you live after a mere drop of 50 or 80 or 100 years. But rather the best thing I suppose would be to be able to live as long as you wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Is it worth continuing to live or is it not wort continuing to live?</strong></p>

<p>good life vs bad life?</p>

<p>The things that are worth having for their own sake, philosophers call <strong>intrinsically valuable</strong>. Instrumentally good or bad things in the list about good vs bad life.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s worth having for its own sake?</strong> Well, one natural suggestion is that pleasure (intrinsically good) is worth having for its own sake and pain (intrinsically bad) is probably worth avoiding for its own sake.</p>

<p>Hedonism is a view that many people are attracted to, it&#8217;s got a very simple theory of the nature of wellbeing. Being well of is a matter of experiencing pleasure and avoiding or minimizing the expirience of pain.</p>

<p>In deciding whether what life holds for you is worth having, better than nothing, you, roughly speaking, add up all the good times and substract all the bad times and see whether the net balance is positive or negative.</p>

<p><strong>Add up all the pleasures, subtract all the pains.</strong></p>

<p>If only I had chosen to become a doctor, instead of having chosen to become a lawyer. How much better off or worse off would I have been? Or if I decide to become an artice or a scholar or a beach bum or a farmer, how much better off or worse off would I have been? You&#8217;re trying to project your future and asking the question &#8220;Where do I think I&#8217;d be better off?&#8221;, which of these branches that are available to me, the branches of my life story which is the one in which the future from here on our holds more pleasure and holds less pain. That&#8217;s how hedonist will think about choises.</p>

<p>We can evaluate this year, or 6 month, or just this evening. I can talk about, well, what should I do tonight? Shoild I stay home and work on my paper? Should I go to the party? Where will I be better off tonight?</p>

<p>We do our evaluation not for the entire lives, but of chunk of lives. That what we can do if we&#8217;re accept hedonism. <strong>Should we accept hedonism?</strong></p>

<p>Robert Nozick, a philosopher who died a few years ago. Nizick invited us to imagine an experience machine, that&#8217;s offer us not just simple rat-machine with impulses to generate pleasure in our brain, he offers, basically, completely realistic virtual reality. When you are hooked up to the machine, it seems to you exactly the same on the inside as it would seem to you if you really were.</p>

<p>You coud have the identical experience of climbing Mount Everest, you&#8217;d feel the wind bracing you. You feel the thrill of having made it to the top and the wind bracingly striking your chin and you feel the satisfaction and you&#8217;ve got the memories of having almost died. Or <strong>write the great american novel</strong> then you&#8217;ve got the experience of staying up late at night not knowing how to make the plot work out, crushing pieces of paper and throwing them away. Or you want to be <strong>finding the cure for cancer</strong>. So you&#8217;ve got exactrly the experience you would have if you were working in your lab having the brilliant breakthrough when you finally realize what the combination is that would make the right antibody. That&#8217;s life on the experience machine. You&#8217;re not doing any of it, you just floating in the lab. But the experience are <strong>identical</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, ask youself then, would you want to spend your life hooked up to the experience machine? How would you feel if you discovered now that you have been living your life hooked up to an experience machine? <strong>Is it the best possible form of human existence?</strong></p>

    <id>http://khakimov.github.com/blog/2013/08/16/august-16-friday</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lucretious says, look, most of us are upset and anxious at the fact that we&#8217;re going to die. We think death is bad for us. There&#8217;ll be this period after my death in which I won&#8217;t exist. And deprivation account helps us to say why it&#8217;s bad, because during this period of nonexistence, you&#8217;re not enjoying the good things in life. But wait a minute, <em>the period after you die isn&#8217;t the only period during which you don&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s not the only period in which if only you were still alive, you could still be enjoying the good things in life. There&#8217;s another period of nonexistence.</em> <strong>It&#8217;s the period before my birth</strong></p>

<p>It is bad? Lucretius says that&#8217;s silly, nobody upset about the fact that there was an eternity before they were born.</p>

<p>Before born you don&#8217;t life, but with death you lost it. So, we can say, that we care about that part after death more than the one before birth. <strong>Because the one after death involves loss, and the one before birth does not.</strong></p>

<p>We imaging to living the longer life. But what is it that happens when I say, if only I&#8217;d been born earlier? Well, says <strong>Feldman</strong>, you don&#8217;t actually imagine a longer life, you just shift the entire life and start it earlier. When we imaging being born earlier we don&#8217;t imaging having longer life. Nothing better about having a life earlier, according to the deprivation account.</p>

<p>So, Feldman says, no wonder, no surprise that you care about the nonexistence after death. Because when you imagine that being different, you imagine a longer life. But when you start thinking about the nonexistence before birth and you imagine that being different, you don&#8217;t imagine more goods in life, you just imagine them taking place at a different time.</p>

<p>Derek Parfit says, it&#8217;s true that when I think about the nonexistence after I die that&#8217;s loss, whereas the nonexistence before I&#8217;m born, that&#8217;s not loss, that&#8217;s mere &#8220;schmoss&#8221;. And it&#8217;s true that we need an explanation about why loss is worse than &#8220;schmoss&#8221;. But we can see that this is not an arbitrary preference on our part, because in fact, it&#8217;s part of a quite general pattern we have of caring about the future in a way that we don&#8217;t care about the past. <strong>This is a very deep fact about human caring. We are oriented towards the future and concerned about what happens in it, in a way that we&#8217;re not oriented and concerned about what happened in the past.</strong></p>

<p>Parfit&#8217;e got a very nice example, imagine that you&#8217;ve got some condition, some sort of medical condition that will kill you unless you have an operation. So fair enought, you&#8217;re going to have the operation. This will allow you to live your life. Unfortunately in order to perfom the operation, they can&#8217;t have you anesthetized. You have to be awayke, perhaps in order to tell the surgeon &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s where it hurts,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a very painful operation. Only one thing we can do is this: give a super local medication and you will not remember anything about the operation itself (24 hours completely wiped out). So you&#8217;re in the hospital and you wake up and you ask yourself, &#8220;Huh, have I had the operation yet or not?&#8221; Don&#8217;t know, right? So you ask the nurse, &#8220;Have I had the operation yet or not?&#8221; She says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, we have a couple on the hall today who are some of whom have had it and some of whom are scheduled to have it later today. Let me go look at your file, I&#8217;ll come back and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221; I want it to be the case that I&#8217;m one of the people who&#8217;s already had the operation. I don&#8217;t want to be one of the people who hasn&#8217;t yet had the operation. <strong>We want the pain to be in the past.</strong> We care more about what&#8217;s happening in the futer than we care about what&#8217;s happening in the past.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Revolution</h1>

<blockquote><p>In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. Communist Manifesto</p></blockquote>

<p>1848 - 1852 what Marx experiences is a period of great disillusion.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers.</p>

<p>The present generation is like the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It now only has a new world to conquer, it must go under in order to make room for the men who are able to cope with a new world. The Class Struggles in France</p></blockquote>

<p>Febraury revolution most the beautiful revolution, it was when everybody was the brother and sisters were all fighting for the same cause. But later on in June of 1848 you get the ugly revoltion. The workers are in the streets of Paris, saying, we want jobs, we want food, we want wages, will allowe us to live well.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s called June Day.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Febraury revolution was the beautiful revolution, the revolution of universal sympathy, because the contradictions which erupted in it against the monarchy were still undeveloped and peacefully dormant, because the social struggle which formed their background had only achieved an ephemeral existence, and existence in phrases, in words. The June revoulution is the ugly revolution, the nasty revolution, because the phrases have given place to the real thing&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>The <strong>realy real</strong> for Marx is class strugle. After the revolution 1848 the realy real become <strong>economic law</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>What taste! What cuisine! What wines! And what speeches! Nothing could make me more scornful of success, considering the price at which it is purchased. I sat unmoved, nauseated by the patriotic fervor they whipped up with mealy platitudes such as &#8216;the abyss toward which we are running&#8217; the &#8216;honor of our flag,&#8217; the &#8216;shadow cast by our standards,&#8217; the &#8216;fraternity of peoples.&#8217; Never will there be a quarter as many ovations for the most beautiful works of the masters. <strong>Flaubert</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1>From metaphysic to value theory</h1>

<p>when somebody dies - it&#8217;s hard for the rest of us.</p>

<p>If we&#8217;re thinking about the central badness of death, it seems to me that we&#8217;ve got to focus on my being dead. What is it about my being dead that&#8217;s bad for me? When I dead, I&#8217;m not exist.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s bad because while you&#8217;re doing this, you&#8217;re not getting something better. Example, stay home and watch something on TV. How it could be bad for me? It&#8217;s a pleasant enought way to spend a half an hour, on the other hand, suppose what I could be doing instead of watching a half an hour of television is being at a really great party.</p>

<p>In this case the fact I stayed at home watching TV is bad for me in this comparative sense. It&#8217;s not in itself an unpleasant way to spend some time. It&#8217;s just there&#8217;s a better way to spend time that I could invest in something else. <em>Theres a lack of the better good</em></p>

<p>A lack is not intrinsically bad, but it&#8217;s still a kind of bad in this second sense. <em>To be lacking a good is itself bad for me.</em></p>

<p>So, nonexistence is bad by virtue of the opportunity costs that are involved. When I don&#8217;t exist I&#8217;m not getting the things that I could have otherwise gotten, if only I were still alive. <strong>Death is bad because it deprives me of the good things in life</strong></p>

<p>How could it be that death is bad for me when I don&#8217;t exist?</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Something can be bad for you only if you exist</li>
<li>When you&#8217;re dead you don&#8217;t exist
=> C. Death can&#8217;t be bad for you.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It does not then concern either the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no more. <strong>Epicurus</strong></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Modest version</strong> A. Something can be bad for you, only if you exist at sometime or the other. (dead can be bad for me)
<strong>Bolder claim</strong> B. Something can be bad for you, only if you exist at the same time as that thing. (then bad can&#8217;t be bad for you)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So the worker the more he works, the more he feels outside himself or that he has lost himself by producing something. But for Marx, when we produce things we see ourselves in what we make, we see a reflection of ourselves that increases our understanding. But in industrial world we see our own alienation, our own distance from ourselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>The worker therefore only feels himself ourside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home&#8230; Lastly, the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else&#8217;s&#8230;</p>

<p>As a result, therefore, man (the worker) only feels himself freely active in his animal functions - eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc; and in his human fuctuons he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marx means that what is truly human about us is our ability to do creative work, we plane, we create and that now (with industrialization) becomes what makes us feel like an animal, like we&#8217;re controlled by others. And we feel free when we do animal functions - eat, sleep, procreate, when we should feel most free when we work.</p>

<blockquote><p>The object of labor is, therefore, the objection of man&#8217;s speciess-life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he sees himself in a world that he has created. In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labor tears from him his species-life&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Our species-life is that we are able to see ourselves in the creative work we do.</p>

<p>Even as we work more and more, we become further and further away from who we should be or who we might become. That&#8217;s a contradiction for Marx. <strong>We&#8217;re living like animals even if we have a greater capacity to be human. That should create a synthesis, that&#8217;s the revolution for Marx.</strong></p>

<p>Dialectic can&#8217;t persist forever, because truth emerges in history, history has to resolve contradictions. Marx says, that when the worker realizes that the worker is oppressed and has to control his own labor, that liberates everyone. That show everyone that the work we do should be our own.</p>

<p>The working class for Marx is the vehicle for the resolution of historical contradictions. And when the worker class will resolve this contradtiction, all the rest of us can wake up, and we can see those contradictions resolved too.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the relationship of estranged labor to private property it follows further that the emancipation (освобождение) of society from private property, etc, from servitude, is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workes; not that their emancipation alone is at stake, but because the emacipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Bourgeosie, the middle class, a most revolutionaty class.</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers. Communist Manifesto.</p>

<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggless.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s bourgeoisie reveal that it&#8217;s economic contradiction that forces people to do things they would otherwise find abhorrent (отвратительный).</p>

<blockquote><p>The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.</p>

<p>All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable (почтенный) prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify (окостеневать). All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relation with his kind.</p></blockquote>

<p>bourgeoisie shows the &#8220;real&#8221; conditions of life, and that for Marx is economic exploitation. That behind marriage is economic exploitation, behind patriarchy is economic exploitation, behind the economy, behind the government. The real conditions of life are alienation and economic exploitation, that once revealed, will make people want to change the conditions of their lives.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About Marx and his teacher Hegel.</p>

<p>Hegel is the most important philosopher in up until his time.</p>

<blockquote><p>The only Thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of Reason; that Reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process. Hegel, Lecture on the Philosophy of History</p></blockquote>

<p>The only place where you can find the truth is in the world, in history.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reason is the substance of the Universe; viz. that by wchi and in which all reality has its being and subsistence. On the other hand, it is the Infinite Energy of the Universe&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Modernity for Hegel is the period in which we understand that the only place we should look for truth is right around us, not in some divine (божественный) or ideal realm.</p>

<blockquote><p>In traversing the past we have only to do with what is present&#8230; The life of the ever present Spitir is a circle of progressive embodiments, which looked at in one aspect still exist beside each other, and only looked at from another point of view appear as past.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dialectical processes are how the past is retained in the present.</p>

<h1>Thesis | Antithesis => Synthesis</h1>

<p>Fathers | Sons => Synthesis or opposit of it - Negation</p>

<hr />

<p>Conflict makes the world go round. History is reasonable. Truth is in the flesh of history, Hegel takes it from being the flesh of Jesus, to being the stuff of history. That&#8217;s the only realm where truth is found. So you can&#8217;t isolate youself and try to find the truth, truth is on the battlefield, in politics, on the streets, the <strong>truth will emerge in history</strong>. That is Hegel&#8217;s strong belieive.</p>

<blockquote><p>The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom; a progress whose development according to the necessity of its nature it is our business to investigate. Hegel</p>

<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Communist Manifesto</p>

<p>On the basis of political economy itself, in its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the most wretched (несчастный) of commodities; that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production&#8230; Marx</p></blockquote>

<p>That creates self-estrangement or alienation. Create more and more, but get less and less, because prices go down and that&#8217;s the problem for workers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.</p></blockquote>

<p>Through your work you see more about yourself, you learn about yourself, from the work you do. Marx says that happenes in capitalism when I make something, it&#8217;s not mine, somebody else takes it away immediately. I make something and the more I make, the more it&#8217;s somebody esle&#8217;s and so by working, I lose myself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ivan Ilych&#8217;s case is very typical, most of at fundamental level don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re going to die.</p>

<p>When people have these near brushes with death, it&#8217;s easy to velieve that the fact of their mortality is more vivid. It&#8217;s something before their eye. And they after that can say, I need to change my life, I need to spent less time at the office and more time with my family, telling the people that I love them, doint the things that are important to me, spending less time to worry about getting ahead, making money, getting the plasma TV.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say when we find the fact of our mortailty is made vivid, when we change our priorites.</p>

<h2>The claim about everybody dies alone</h2>

<p>Nobody can die your death for you, nobody can take your part. It doesn&#8217;t express very clearly. But what about the cases when person die in car acident in the middle of conversation. He die very fast and seems to me in this case we can say he dies alone, it was very fast.</p>

<p>But what about Socrates? He was not lonely. Hume died, had illines, he used to talk about various matters with friends, he was cheefrul and pleasent to the end. And here is no reason at all to believe that he was feeling lonely.</p>

<h1>Is Death Bad?</h1>

<p>When I die I ceased to exists. We want to turn to ethical question about death. Why is death bad? How death can be death?</p>

<p>Value questions. How and in what ways the death is bad? Is death bad? What makes it bad?</p>

<p>John&#8217;s death is bad for John&#8217;s friends and family. When somebody dies, we lose the chance to continue interacting with a person.</p>

<p><strong>How could it be true that death is bad for the person that dies?</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We don&#8217;t have P-functioning when we sleep, so should we say we dead then? Well, that&#8217;s clearly not the right thing to say.</p>

<h2>What is it to be dead?</h2>

<p>It can&#8217;t be just a matter of not <strong>P-functioning</strong>. Suppose that to be alive is to be able to engage in P-functioning.</p>

<p>Sometimes people say that we die alone or everybody dies alone. Somehow, at some level, nobody really believes they&#8217;re going to die at all. Since it&#8217;s impossible to picture being dead, nobody believes in the possibility that they&#8217;re going to die, that they&#8217;re going to cease to exist.</p>

<p>What is it like to be dead? We can&#8217;t imagine being dead. But can we imagine being cell phone or bold ball pen? No, so, there&#8217;s no mystery about what it&#8217;s like to be dead - <strong>it isn&#8217;t like anything</strong>. There is nothing there to describe. When you&#8217;re dead there&#8217;s nothing happening on the inside to be imagined.</p>

<p>From the mere fact that you can&#8217;t picture from the inside what it&#8217;s like to be dead, it doesn&#8217;t follow that nobody believes they&#8217;re going to die.</p>

<p>You can not picture it from the inside, but you can picture it from the outside. Dreamless or fainting - picture of my body lying on the bed or ground unconscious. I can picture my being dead quit easily, no functioning occuring in my body.</p>

<p>Everytime I try to picture myself being dead, I smuggle myself back in, conscious and existing as a person, hence, not dead as a person. Maybe my body (i imagining my body dead, but i&#8217;m not imagining myself, the person, dead).</p>

<p>Nobody believes they&#8217;re going to undergo bodily death?</p>
